When a user clicks **Build My App** or builds an app via CI/CD, Appdome leverages a microservice architecture of 1000s of security plugins and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured Android and iOS apps. There is no SDK or library to code or implement manually. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nAppdome users can create mobile app security templates, known as Fusion Sets, to speed up and repeat mobile app security projects. Fusion Sets can include validated, approved, required, or known combinations of features, services, and configurations for your app. You can reuse Fusion Sets across different builds and releases, share them with various teams, or subscribe Fusion Sets to multiple mobile apps at one time.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for creating, using, and managing Fusion Sets in Android and iOS apps.\n\n## What are Appdome Fusion Sets?\n\nFusion Sets are pre-built, reusable, sharable mobile app security templates that contain all the selected security features, settings, options, and configurations that Appdome builds into your iOS and Android apps whenever you build your app. Fusion Sets accelerate and automate mobile security implementations, ensure implementation consistency, and reduce integration time for each build or release of your mobile apps.\n\n### **Prerequisites for using Appdome Fusion Sets**\n\nIn order to use Appdome Fusion Sets features, you will need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=27234274.49bb98018906effb0756125a31e6ed9f.1733998788526.1735635625729.1735638182097.11&__hssc=27234274.9.1735638182097&__hsfp=2793181194))\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project?__hstc=27234274.49bb98018906effb0756125a31e6ed9f.1733998788526.1735635625729.1735638182097.11&__hssc=27234274.9.1735638182097&__hsfp=2793181194)\u00a0(.ipa For iOS device or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/?__hstc=27234274.49bb98018906effb0756125a31e6ed9f.1733998788526.1735635625729.1735638182097.11&__hssc=27234274.9.1735638182097&__hsfp=2793181194)\u00a0and\u00a0[**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/?__hstc=27234274.49bb98018906effb0756125a31e6ed9f.1733998788526.1735635625729.1735638182097.11&__hssc=27234274.9.1735638182097&__hsfp=2793181194))\n\n### Default Playground Fusion Set\n\nA default Playground Fusion Set is created automatically for each app uploaded to Appdome. It is a unique, app-specific Fusion Set designed for testing and experimentation. The Playground Fusion Set has the following limitations:\n\n* It **cannot be shared** between apps or released to Team Workspaces.\n* It **only affects the app** for which it was created.\n* It does **not support versioning history**.\n* It cannot be modified in the following ways:\n  + **Renaming**\n  + **Deleting** (it can only be reset to blank mode, which turns off all toggles).\n\n    ![Fs My App](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fs-my-app-1.png)\n\n    - **Freezing Fusion Sets:** For more details, see [How to Freeze-Lock Protection Templates for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/freeze-lock-moible-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-rcs-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n    - **Used for API actions:** For more details, see [Appdome API documentation](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/introduction)\n\nHowever, it is possible to duplicate the Playground Fusion Set, including all its settings, by clicking the **Copy** icon. This allows the creation of a new Fusion Set based on the Playground Fusion Set\u2019s configuration, which can then be further modified or shared as needed.\n\n![Fs My App 3](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fs-my-app-3.png)\n\n![My App Fs Create 4](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/my-app-fs-create-4-1.png)\n\n## **How to Create and Use Fusion Sets for Android and iOS Apps**\n\nYou can either use the default Playground Fusion Set or Create a new Fusion Set.\n\n### Creating a New Fusion Set\n\nAs a best practice, you are strongly advised to create a new blank fusion set and populate it with different security features.\n\n**To create a new Fusion Set:**\n\n1. Open the Fusion Set drop-down list by clicking the arrow icon on the right.  \n   ![Fs My App 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fs-my-app-2-2.png)\n2. Click **Create New Fusion Set** to create a new blank Fusion Set.  \n   ![Fs Create My App 5](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fs-create-my-app-5-1.png)\n3. Enter a name in the text box.  \n   ![Fs My App 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fs-my-app-2-3.png)\n4. Click **Save**.  \n   **Note**: You must assign a unique name, as there cannot be two Fusion Sets that have the same name.\n\n### Reviewing the Fusion Set List\n\nThe Fusion Sets list allows viewing at a glance multiple details about each of the Fusion Sets.\n\n![My Fs List 6](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/my-fs-list-6.png)\n\nThe selected Fusion Set is indicated by the green checkmark on the left.\n\n**To view and edit details about a specific Fusion Set**:\n\n1. Select the requested Fusion Set by clicking the check box on the left.\n2. Click the **Details** button on the right.  \n   ![My Fs 7](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/my-fs-7.png)\n3. Use the **Fusion Set Details** tab to change one or more details about the selected Fusion Set.  \n   ![fs details ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-05-24-at-17.26.36.png)\n4. Click the icon to the right of the **Fusion Set Name** field to rename the Fusion Set, and click **Save** when done.  \n   ![Screen Shot 2023 05 24 At 17.29.34](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-05-24-at-17.29.34.png)\n\nClicking a Fusion Set name allows renaming the Fusion Set, as seen below.\n\n![FUSION SETS](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-05-24-at-17.35.56.png)\n\nThe **Services** section in each row allows viewing the services assigned to each Fusion Set.\n\nThe Fusion Set row displayed the time and date when the last modification took place. If the Fusion Set was imported, the row displays from which team it was imported.\n\n![Modified Fusion Sets](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Modified-Fusion-Sets.png)\n\nThe Fusion Set row can also be used for performing the following operations:\n\n* **Copying** (duplicating) an existing Fusion Set by clicking **Copy**.  \n  ![Fs Copy](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FS-copy.png)\n* **Subscribing** all Android/iOS apps to the selected template (Fusion Set).  \n  ![Subscribe Fs ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/subscribe-fs_.png)\n* **Deleting** the Fusion Set (if the Fusion Set is frozen, you should unfreeze it prior to deleting).  \n  ![Fs Delete](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fs-delete.png)  \n  Deleting a Fusion Set affects all apps that are subscribed to the Fusion Set at the time of the deletion. After the deletion operation is confirmed, all subscribed apps will revert to be subscribed to the Playground Fusion Set.  \n  ![Screen Shot 2023 05 24 At 18.00.30](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-05-24-at-18.00.30.png)\n\n### How to Subscribe Apps to a Fusion Set\n\n**To Subscribe all iOS or Android apps to a Fusion Set (optional):**\n\n1. Go to the **Build** tab and select the app.\n2. Click the down arrow at the rightmost location of the law to expand the section as shown below.  \n   ![Screen Shot 2023 05 24 At 18.08.36](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-05-24-at-18.08.36.png)\n3. Scroll down to the Fusion Set to which you want to subscribe your apps and hover over it. While hovering over the Fusion Set, click the **\\*** (asterisk) icon to **Subscribe all Android or iOS apps to this Fusion Set**.  \n   ![Subscribe on row V1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FS-SUBSCRIBE.png)\n4. When prompted, confirm to subscribe all apps to the selected Fusion Set.  \n   ![Apply to all my apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-05-24-at-18.13.14-e1695799531231.png)  \n   A notification is displayed to inform that the operation has been completed successfully.  \n   ![Screen Shot 2023 05 24 At 18.14.09](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-05-24-at-18.14.09-e1695799552901.png)\n\nYou can now add to your mobile security template by adding features and services to the Fusion Set and creating custom implementations to suit specific use cases. You can also subscribe to new apps or remove apps from this Fusion Set to complete multiple projects in parallel.\n\n### Reviewing the Fusion Set Details\n\nYou can review the Fusion Set details by clicking the **Details** button.  \n![Details button](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-05-24-at-18.16.10-1300x99.png)  \nThe **Details** dialog box opens now.  \n![View Fusion Set Details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/View-fusion-set-details.png)\n\nYou can use this dialog box to view the following tabs:\n\n1. **Fusion Set Details** \u2013 Contains the details listed below.\n\n   * Signing Credentials  \n     Indication of the signing credential saved in this Fusion Set (app-specific). It is now possible to remove signing credentials from a Fusion Set if they are no longer needed. To remove signing credentials, navigate to the Signing Credentials field, click the **Remove Credentials** button, and confirm the action.\n   * Fusion Set ID  \n     Unique FS ID for API users. For details, see [API Documentation](https://apis.appdome.com/docs).\n   * Annotation  \n     An annotation was added during the last modification of the Fusion Set.  \n     Below the annotation, you can see the date and time and the user who had updated the FS. For further details, see below the section **Annotating a Fusion Set**.\n   * Freeze settings  \n     For details, see the [freeze the Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/freeze-lock-moible-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-rcs-in-devsecops-build-system/) Knowledge Base article.\n2. **Subscribed Apps** \u2013 Names and details of the apps subscribed to the selected Fusion Set.  \n   ![Fusion Set Summary Apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fusion-set-summary-apps-e1695814960878.png)\n\n### Saving and Annotating a Fusion Set\n\nOn the platform footer, near the\u00a0**Build My App**\u00a0and\u00a0**Annotate Changes**\u00a0buttons, you can see the data on when and by whom your fusion set was last modified. When you perform one or more modifications in the Fusion Set, the\u00a0**Annotate Changes button** becomes enabled at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe annotation is meant to provide Appdome users with enhanced transparency and control over their security service selections.  \nThe time and date of the modification are visible below the annotation, and you need to use the annotation field to specify what the modification was and the reasons for the modification.\n\n![Toggle Annotate Changes ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/toggle-annotate-changes-1-1.png)\n\n**To annotate a fusion set**:\n\n1. Click **Annotate Changes**.  \n   The dialog box **Add Fusion Set Annotation** opens.  \n   ![add fusion set annotaition](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/add-annotaition-.png)\n2. Set Fusion Set version, including numbers and dots (optional).  \n   Enter the requested text for the annotation (up to 250 characters).  \n   Ensure that you enter meaningful, helpful text, ideally with the following information:  \n   Meaningful description; for example, the purpose of the modification, the targeted group (QA, development, and so on), and the month of the release.  \n   ![Fusion Set Annotaiton applied](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fusion-set-annotaiton.png)\n3. Click **Save**.  \n   Now, your Fusion Set is saved and annotated.  \n   When you produce a Certified Secure certificate, the certificate displays the annotation.  \n   ![Certificate My AppCert With Annotation V1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Certificate-my-app-650x309.png)\n\n**Note:**  \nIf you do not click the **Annotate Changes** button but instead click **Build My App**, an annotation will automatically be added.  \nAutomatic annotations also will be added when the following operations take place:\n\n* Building (when there are changes in the Fusion Set)\n* Freezing an Appdome Version\n* Unfreezing an Appdome Version\n* Unfreezing a Fusion Set\n* Session Time Out\n* Selecting to save signing credentials when prompted to\n* Renaming a Fusion Set\n* Adding OS Coverage\n\n## How to Sign & Publish\u00a0Secured Mobile Apps Built on\u00a0Appdome\n\nAfter successfully securing your app using\u00a0Appdome, there are several available options to complete your project, depending on\u00a0your\u00a0app lifecycle or workflow.

Preventing these functionalities adds additional protection against data leakage. Appdome offers several options for preventing screen sharing and copy/paste in Android and iOS apps. The implementation, however, is different when the device on which the app is installed is a managed or a BYOD device.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article describes the functionality difference in preventing Android and iOS screenshots on managed and unmanaged (BYOD) devices.\n\n### Managed Devices\n\nIf an end-user is using a managed device (either corporate issued or managed BYOD), you (the Appdome user) would fuse the relevant EMM-MAM service to the app and use the EMM-MAM to control/block screen captures and enable copy/paste prevention. Of course, you could augment the EMM-MAM protections with Appdome specific features as well as use Appdome DEV-Events to notify you (in the app, to the app server, etc.) if and when screen captures were taken.\n\n### Non-Managed Devices\n\nIf end-user is using a non-managed device (true BYOD), you would fuse Appdome\u2019s Block Screen Capture, Copy/Paste prevention (and additional features such as Blur Screen as required) to the app. These features do not require a management system and can be applied to all apps \u2013 without or without a management system. The protection is placed inside the app as if the developer added that protection in the app.\n\n### OS-specific Implementations\n\nIn Android, the implementation-enforcement is self-contained in the app. Users trying to take a screenshot will only see a \u201cblack screen\u201d in any attempt. In iOS, it\u2019s a little different based on the way iOS is designed. In iOS, the default behavior of Appdome\u2019s Block Screen Capture is to \u201cnotify\u201d on the event. In iOS, the user is notified that screen capture is not allowed. As an Appdome admin, you can enhance this implementation with Appdome\u2019s DEV-Events to send a notification to IT, Compliance, or to the app via Appdome\u2019s API directly to the app server or the authentication service used to authenticate the user to the app, etc. This would allow you to revoke access to the app if/when a screen capture is taken.\n\nEither way, Appdome\u2019s implementations cover all forms of screen capture \u2013 screenshots, screen recording and mirroring. So, we offer 360\u02da protection with or without an EMM-MAM.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Disable-Screen-Shots-on-Managed-and-BYOD-650x366.png)\n\n## After Adding Mobile App Screenshot Prevention to an app \u2013 What\u2019s next?\n\nAfter you have added Prevent App Screen Sharing and Copy/Paste Protection to your app, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the App\n\nAppdome is a full featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.\n\nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps).\n\n### Sign the App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome built app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode) and [Signing an Android app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) is easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), to download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the App to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Fused apps, please read [this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome with Prevent App Screen Sharing and Copy/Paste prevention in your app!\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [**support.appdome.com**](http://support.appdome.com/ \"http://support.appdome.com/\") or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

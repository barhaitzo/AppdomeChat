These identifiers are crucial for facilitating seamless integration between different software components. Managed through attributes like `@_cdecl` for C compatibility and `@objc` for Objective-C and Swift, these names define the interfaces that allow external code to link with and utilize the functionalities of a library or framework.\n\n## **Why Strip Export Names?**\n\nEnhancing the security of your iOS SDK involves stripping export names, which makes it challenging for attackers to identify and manipulate critical functions. This security measure obscures the internal architecture and functionalities of the SDK, thereby reducing the risk of targeted exploits and unauthorized access. For SDK vendors, this practice is crucial in protecting intellectual property and ensuring that their software components remain secure against reverse engineering efforts.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Strip Export Names\n\nBefore you can utilize the **Strip Export Names** feature, ensure you have the following:\n\n* An active Appdome account. [**Create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1723561940713.1723620952010.126&__hssc=267077713.1.1723620952010&__hsfp=4047532501)\n* A license for **Strip Export Names**\n* **Your Mobile SDK** (accepted formats include .xcframework.zip for iOS).\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide for Using Strip Export Names\n\nFollow these simple steps on Appdome to secure Android SDKs:\n\n1. [**Upload**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1720706029100.1720941324560.53&__hssc=79098507.9.1720941324560&__hsfp=2459653256) the Mobile SDK to Appdome.\n   * **Upload Method:** Choose either Appdome Console or DEV-API\n   * **iOS Format:** .xcframework.zip\n2. **Build the feature:** Strip Export Names\n\n### **Building Strip Export Names using Appdome\u2019s DEV-API:**\n\n1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will include the Strip Export Names feature.  \n   ![New Fusion Set Strip Export Names](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/New-Fusion-Set-Strip-export-Names.png)  \n   Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Strip Export Names feature  \n   **Note:** Naming the Fusion Set according to the selected protections is optional and serves only for illustration purposes.\n2. Follow the steps in the section Building the Strip Export Names feature via Appdome Console of this article to add the Strip Export Names feature to this Fusion Set\n3. Click the \u201c\u2026\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set to open the Fusion Set Detail Summary and copy the Fusion Set ID from the summary.  \n   [![Fsid](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FSID.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FSID.png)  \n   Figure 2: Fusion Set Detail Summary  \n   **Note:** Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protections selected is optional.\n4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, App Center, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, or Circle CI:\n   * Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s\u00a0[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python)\n   * Build an API for the SDK \u2013 for instructions, see the tasks under [Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1720706029100.1720941324560.53&__hssc=79098507.9.1720941324560&__hsfp=2459653256)\n\n### Build the **Strip Export Names feature via Appdome Console**\n\n1. 1. Create a Fusion Set as shown above.\n   2. **Where:** Inside the Appdome Console, go to\u00a0**Build SDKProtect\u2122**\u00a0Tab >\u00a0**SDK Threat-Shielding** section.\n   3. **How:** Toggle on **Obfuscate SDK Logic** > **Strip Export Names**.\n   4. **Exclude Specific Classes:**\n      * To ensure that essential functionality and integration capabilities are maintained, Appdome provides an option to exclude certain classes from the export name-stripping process:\n        + Navigate to the \u201c**Strip Export Names**\u201d section.\n        + Locate the \u201c**Exclude Specific Classes**\u201d field.\n        + Enter the name of each class you need to exclude from obfuscation.\n        + Click the \u2018**+ Add**\u2019 button to confirm each entry. This ensures that these classes retain their clear export names, facilitating necessary integrations and functionalities.\n        + This exclusion process can be repeated for any class that requires clear visibility.\n\n      ![Toggle Strip Export Names](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Toggle-Strip-Export-Names.png)\n\n      Figure 3: Strip Export Names option\n   5. When you enable Strip Export Names, the Fusion Set you created now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Strip Export Names.  \n      ![Saved Fusion Set Verify Sdk Assets & Libs](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saved-Fusion-Set-Verify-SDK-Assets-Libs.png)\n\n      Figure 4: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Strip Export Names protection\n   6. Click **Build My SDK** at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in Figure 3).\n\n**Congratulations!**  You have successfully added the Strip Export Names protection to your mobile SDK.\n\n### Certify the Strip Export Names feature in Android Apps.\n\nAfter building the Strip Export Names, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to confirm the addition and protection of the Strip Export Names feature in the mobile SDK. To verify this, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate.  \n![Certificate Strip Export Names](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Certificate-Strip-Export-Names.png)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[How to Encrypt Android SDK DBs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/encrypt-android-sdk-dbs/)\n\n[Automated SDK Protection & Appdome SDKProtect\u2122](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/step-by-step-guide-to-securing-mobile-sdks-with-appdomes-sdk-protect/)\n\n[How to Obfuscate Mobile SDK Logic Using Appdome SDKProtect\u2122](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/protect-your-sdk-with-appdome/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1722869018375.1722949060198.118&__hssc=79098507.1.1722949060198&__hsfp=4047532501)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1722869018375.1722949060198.118&__hssc=79098507.1.1722949060198&__hsfp=4047532501)!

However, iOS security models are sensitive to instrumentation, dynamic inspection, and jailbreaking indicators, which can lead to app exits or error conditions. Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service provides mobile app automation testing designed to accelerate the delivery of secure iOS apps globally. It enables continuous testing of Appdome-secured apps without compromising security, allowing seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines and testing infrastructures.\u00a0 With Build2Test, you can test iOS apps using automated testing platforms like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, BitBar, and LambdaTest\u2014without triggering security alerts, errors, or app crashes. Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model identifies the unique runtime signature of approved test environments. Even if these services use intrusive testing tools (e.g., Magisk, Frida), Appdome safely suppresses alerts and allows uninterrupted testing, without requiring changes to the app binary, fusion sets, or entitlements.\n\nAppdome\u2019s Build2Test service can be used in either of the following ways:\n\n* Via [Appdome DEV-API](https://apis.appdome.com/docs).\n* Via Appdome\u2019s Console (see the instructions below)\n\n## Use Build2Test Service via the Appdome Console\n\n### Before You Begin\n\n* Any events encountered when testing the selected service will not raise alarms and notifications. With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of the selected testing service and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida.\n* Ensure you have the following:\n  + [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=79098507.cb249e6cb815c754ee1ea4633650c79f.1683458843950.1683458843950.1683547752843.2&__hssc=79098507.1.1683547752843&__hsfp=3783124442).\n  + An Appdome version supporting the Build2Test service.

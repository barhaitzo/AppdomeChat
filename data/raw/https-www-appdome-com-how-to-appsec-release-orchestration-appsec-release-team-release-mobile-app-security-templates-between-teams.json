Sharing tested and working [Fusion Sets](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/build-security-template-android-ios-apps/) is the way to achieve a smooth process from development all the way to production.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article describes how to release a Fusion Set security template with other Appdome Teams as part of the security release management process.\n\n## How to Release Fusion Sets between Teams\n\nAppdome provides the ability to Release Fusion Sets across all teams and apps in an account. This way, Appdome users avoid repeating the same configuration tasks for each app in each team, which is tedious, time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n### Prerequisites for Releasing a Fusion Set\n\nTo release a Fusion Set you need to have:\n\n* An Appdome account \u2013 if you do not have an account yet, [click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)\n* A mobile app\n* Android (.apk or .aab) or iOS (.ipa). [Click here to add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\n* [Appdome for Teams](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/use-team-workflows-mobile-app-security-projects/)\n* A license to Release Fusion Sets and appropriate [Entitlements](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/set-user-entitlements-mobile-app-security-projects/) for the actions you need to perform\n\n## How to Use Appdome Release Fusion Set (without Separation of Duties)\n\n**To release a Fusion Set to another Appdome team**:\n\n1. Select the requested team space for the source Appdome team.\n2. Go to **Team Fusion Sets** drop-down and click the icon **Release Fusion Set to Team**\u00a0(which becomes visible when hovering).  \n   ![Release Fs To Team](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Release-FS-to-team.png)  \n   Alternatively, click the \u2026 (**Details**) icon to open Fusion Set Summary, with the **Fusion Set details**\u00a0tab displayed by default, and the click **Release Fusion Set** on the bottom left corner.  \n   ![Fusion Set Deatails 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fusion-set-deatails-2-e1692872209558.png)\n3. Use the **Release Fusion Set to Team** dialog box that opens now to select the team to which you want to release the Fusion Set. Alternatively, if your release process or organization requires compliance with a separation of duties process and your company has the required license, select the Release Fusion Set to New Team option instead. For details, see the article [How to Release Mobile App Protection Templates Between Teams in DevSecOps Build System](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/release-mobile-app-protection-templates-between-teams-in-devsecops-build-system/).![Release To Team 3](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/release-to-team-3.png)  \n   If you want to have your Fusion Set released with its freeze settings, ensure that you freeze the Fusion Set first and then select the check box **Include Fusion Set Freeze Settings**.  \n   To Release the Fusion Set with app-specific settings such as context and app-signing settings and credentials,\u00a0 select the check box **Include App Specific Settings** and then select the app from the drop-down list (optional).  \n   ![Release To Team 4](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/release-to-team-4-1.png)\n4. Click\u00a0**Release**\u00a0to release the Fusion set to the other team.  \n   If the team is successfully released, the notification shown below is displayed.  \n   ![Fusion Set Deatails 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/released-to-team5-1.png)\n5. Click **Go to Team** to be redirected to the team to which you released your Fusion Set.  \n   If there is a mismatch between the permissions of the source team and the permissions of the target team, the notification shown below is displayed, in which case you need to contact [Appdome Support](https://support.appdome.com/).  \n   ![teams permission are not matching ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2023-07-31-at-11.32.png)  \n   **Note**:  \n   A mismatch indication will also appear on the receiving app\u2019s side.  \n   ![Fusion Set Imported 7](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fusion-set-imported-7-e1692872248115.png)\n\nAfter you have released your Fusion Set with another team, entitled members of that team can use it to build apps on that team.\n\n## Related Articles\n\nHere are some related Knowledge Base articles on managing and releasing Fusion Sets as part of a Security Release Management:\n\n* [How to Build Mobile Security Templates for all iOS/Android Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/build-security-template-android-ios-apps/)\n* [Release Security Templates (Fusion Sets) to Teams \u2013 Separation of Duties](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/release-fusion-set-segregation-of-duties/)\n* You can [Request a Demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/) at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

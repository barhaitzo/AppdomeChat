To mitigate these risks, implementing Appdome\u2019s Anti-Remote Desktop Scam is crucial. This feature ensures that your app cannot be used through AnyDesk, preserving the integrity of user interactions and protecting sensitive data from potential exposure in remote desktop scenarios. This guide walks you through the steps to verify that your protected application incorporates Anti-Remote Desktop Scam effectively, ensuring it cannot run in tandem with AnyDesk, thereby safeguarding user interactions and sensitive data.\n\n## **Prerequisites**\n\nTo test Anti Remote Desktop Scam, you will need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for\u00a0**Prevent Remote Desktop Scam**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) )\n* Two (2) mobile devices.\n\n## Performing the Test\n\n**To test Anti Remote Desktop Scam protection in AnyDesk**:\n\n1. Build an app with the Anti Remote Desktop Scam feature enabled.  \n   For detailed instructions on how to build this feature, visit the main knowledge base article\u00a0[How to Prevent Remote Desktop Scam in Android Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/account-takeover-prevention/social-engineering-prevention/prevent-remote-desktop-scams-in-android-apps/)  \n   [![Android Prevent Remote Desktop Scam Toggle](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Android_Prevent_Remote_Desktop_Scam_Toggle.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Android_Prevent_Remote_Desktop_Scam_Toggle.png)\n2. Install the protected app on mobile device 1.\n3. Download and install AnyDesk Remote Desktop on both mobile devices from the [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anydesk.anydeskandroid&hl=en&gl=US).\n4. Open AnyDesk on both mobile devices.  \n   *![Any Desk Address](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Any-Desk-address-1.png)*\n5. Enter *Your Address* number from mobile device 1 in the *Enter Remote Address* box on mobile device 2.\n6. Accept the connection on mobile device 2.  \n   ![Accept Request Anydesk](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Accept-request_AnyDesk-2-e1714029806786.png)\n7. Click **Start now** on mobile device 2.  \n   ![Anydesk Startnow](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot_20240410_152409_One-UI-Home-341x731.jpg)\n8. Open the protected app on mobile device 1.\n9. Verify the functionality of the Anti-Remote Desktop Scam protection.  \n   **Expected Result:** You should see a security alert on the second device\u2019s screen, blocking the app from opening while AnyDesk is active. This alert confirms that the Anti-Remote DesktopControl is operational.  \n   ![Appdome Threat Event Pop Up Message Detected Remote Desktop Control](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Appdome-threat-event-pop-up-message-detected-remote-desktop-control-e1713361231520-342x731.png)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [Testing Anti Remote Desktop Scam for iOS in Zoom](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/malware-controls/testing-anti-remote-desktop-control-for-ios-in-zoom/)\n* [Testing Anti Remote Desktop Scam for iOS in AnyDesk](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/malware-controls/testing-anti-remote-desktop-control-for-ios-in-anydesk/)\n* [Testing Anti Remote Desktop Scam for iOS in TeamViewer](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/malware-controls/testing-anti-remote-desktop-control-for-ios-in-teamviewer/)\n* [Testing Anti Remote Desktop Scam for Android in TeamViewer](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/malware-controls/testing-anti-remote-desktop-control-in-teamviewer/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\u00a0\n\n### **Thank you!**\n\nThanks for visiting [Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.cb249e6cb815c754ee1ea4633650c79f.1683458843950.1683458843950.1683547752843.2&__hssc=79098507.1.1683547752843&__hsfp=3783124442)!

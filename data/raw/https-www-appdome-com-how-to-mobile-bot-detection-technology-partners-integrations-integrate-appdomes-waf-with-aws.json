When combined with Appdome\u2019s [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/) solution, businesses can achieve an unparalleled level of protection for their mobile applications. This article will guide you on configuring your **AWS Virtual Server** to connect to a WAF so it can work seamlessly with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense.\n\nBefore delving into the steps, let\u2019s understand some of the terms used:\n\n**MTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security):**\u00a0Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a method for mutual authentication in which both parties in a network connection validate the SSL certificates presented by each other against a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.\n\n**Client Certificate:** In cryptography, a client certificate is a type of digital certificate is used by client systems to make authenticated requests to a remote server.\n\n**Safe Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are determined to be safe or not at risk of any threat.\n\n**At-Risk Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are potentially under threat or have detected anomalies.\n\n**Header Payload:**\u00a0The data transferred in the header of HTTP requests or responses. Protecting this data ensures that it cannot be tampered with during transit.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using AWS & Appdome Docker Image\n\nIn order to use the AWS Virtual Server in conjunction with Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* An AWS server with admin permissions\n* An Android or iOS app secured by Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense\n* An Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense License\n\n### How to Configure the WAF to Parse Safe Session and At-Risk Session\n\nWhen Appdome\u2019s code is integrated into the AWS Virtual Server, it enhances the firewall\u2019s capability to determine the validity of a session. To categorize sessions as \u201cSafe Session\u201d or \u201cAt Risk Session\u201d, Appdome\u2019s code analyzes specific headers within incoming requests: Timestamp, Nonce, and SignedMessage. The Timestamp header allows Appdome\u2019s code to detect potential delay attacks by comparing the request\u2019s timestamp with the server\u2019s time. The Nonce, a unique random value, ensures the uniqueness of each request, protecting against replay attacks. The SignedMessage, typically an RSA-encrypted SHA256 hash of the timestamp, nonce, and a shared secret, ensures the integrity of the request.\n\n## Getting Started with AWS Setup and Configuration\n\n### Setting up a Linux Server on AWS\n\nFollow these steps to configure a Linux server on AWS and launch a Docker container with open network settings.\n\n1. **Create an EC2 instance**\n   * + In the AWS portal, navigate to the EC2 Dashboard**.**\n   * Click \u201c**Launch Instance**\u201d to create a new EC2 instance.\n2. **Create a Virtual Machine (VM)**\n   * In the AWS portal, go to **EC2 -> Instances -> Launch an Instance**\n   * Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS)  \n     ![Name And Tag-launch an instance](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/name-and-tag.png)\n3. **Select Instance type**\n   * **Note:** Make sure to select a VPC that allows the AWS server to send and receive traffic from both the server (i.e. Radware) and your organization end-point server.  \n     ![Instance Type-t12 micro](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instance-type.png)\n4. **Configure security groups**\n   * This allow inbound traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443).  \n     ![Inbound Files sg ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/inbound-files.png)\n5. **Click on Launch Instance**  \n   ![Launch Instance-summary](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Launch-instance.png)\n6. **Select your newly created instance.**\n\n### Connect SSH to Your EC2 Instance\n\n1. Click **Connect**  \n   ![Screen Shot 2023 10 12 At 9.43](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-12-at-9.43-1.png)\n2. Navigate to the **SSH Client** Tab  \n   ![connect t instance](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-12-at-9.45-1.png)\n\n3. Enter the following SSH command to connect to your EC2 Instance\n\n```\n ssh -i YOUR_KEY_PAIR.pem ec2-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_IP\n```\n\n**Note:** Make sure to replace placeholders such as YOUR\\_KEY\\_PAIR.pem, YOUR\\_INSTANCE\\_IP, and any other specific details with your actual values and preferences.\n\n### Running a Docker Container on an AWS Server\n\nInside your EC2 instance, install Docker:\n\n```\n sudo yum update -y\n```\n\n```\nsudo amazon-linux-extras install docker\n```\n\n```\nsudo service docker start\n```\n\n```\nsudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user IP\n```\n\n**Run a Docker Container**\n\n```\n docker run hello-world\n```\n\nValidate that it works by connecting to it with an ssh such as:\n\n```\nssh ubuntu@my.machine.net\n```\n\nTo learn more, see the installation instructions for [Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)\n\n## Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image\n\nAfter setting up your server of choice, proceed to configure the Appdome Docker Image as outlined in our dedicated knowledge base article, [How to Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image for MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/configure-appdomes-docker-image/).\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/?__hstc=79098507.401d371c0544861b105826ea18331520.1694613928928.1696936668693.1696938871677.75&__hssc=79098507.2.1696938871677&__hsfp=333572129)\n* [Using F5 WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrating-f5-waf-with-appdome-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n* [Using Akamai WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrate-appdomes-docker-image-with-akamais-waf-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n* [Using Cloudflare WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrated-cloudflare-waf-with-appdome-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)!

By validating certificates during the TLS/SSL handshake, certificate pinning mitigates the risk of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, where attackers use compromised or fraudulent certificates to intercept communications. This prevents apps from connecting to malicious servers and safeguards sensitive data.\n\nAttackers commonly target mobile apps by manipulating DNS, public certificate authorities, or session data to insert altered certificates. Implementing certificate pinning during development ensures secure app-server communication, protecting app data, and ensuring compliance with standards such as OWASP MASVS and PCI-DSS.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Mobile Apps With Certificate Pinning\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic Certificate Pinning plugin for Android/iOS embeds trusted certificates securely inside the app, encrypting and protecting them with Appdome\u2019s ONEShield\u2122 app shielding (RASP) technology. During the TLS/SSL handshake, the plugin validates certificates, session states, and Certificate Authorities (CAs) to detect mismatches or modifications. If a compromised certificate is detected, the connection is blocked before attackers can intercept or manipulate communications. Developers can pin certificates for specific domains or use wildcard values to secure multiple endpoints, ensuring trusted app-server communication and preventing MitM attacks.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to build secured apps with Secure Certificate Pinning\n\n* Appdome account (If you don\u2019t have an Appdome account, [create a free Appdome account here](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n### Secure Certificate Pinning Profiles:\n\nAppdome offers the following 5 mutually exclusive options (pinning profiles) to implement Secure Certificate Pinning in any iOS or Android app:\n\n* **Chain Evaluation** \u2013 evaluates the chain of trust used by the Root Certificate and Intermediate Certificate uploaded to Appdome by the user, and will trust only those intermediate and leaf certificates that are trusted by the uploaded certificates. Basically, this locks the chain of trust. Any mismatch is a security event.\n* **Strict Evaluation** \u2013 evaluates the exact fingerprint of server certificate uploaded to Appdome against the certificate returned by the server. This is equivalent to Leaf certificate pinning. If the server returns a different certificate, the mismatch is a security event.\n* **Root Evaluation** \u2013 only evaluates that the root CA returned for the specified domain/host (FQDN) matches the Root CA Certificate uploaded to Appdome. Because the CA certificates are valid for 10+ years, this setup will not require updates when the leaf certificate or the intermediate certificates are renewed (i.e., the server can return an updated intermediate or leaf certificate without invoking a security event). By pinning against the root certificate only, any changes to the customer\u2019s intermediate or leaf certificates will work without having to update the app.\n* **Public Key Evaluation** \u2013 only evaluates the server\u2019s certificate public key to ensure complete continuity of service when the certificate is renewed if the new server certificate comes with the same public key.\n* **No Pinning** \u2013 certificate chains received for the specific domain will not be verified by Appdome. They will normally fall back to the OS\u2019s default verification process.\n\n## Follow These Easy Steps to Use Secure Certificate Pinning in Android & iOS apps\n\nPlease\u00a0follow these easy steps to add **Secure Certificate Pinning** to any iOS and Android app using Appdome.\u00a0\n\n1. [**Upload**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) an Android or iOS App to Appdome\u2019s no code security platform (.apk, .aab, or .ipa)\n2. In the **Build** Tab, under **Security**, expand **Secure Communication****,**switch ON **Secure Certificate Pinning**\n3. Enter a **Service Domain**\n4. Select a **Pinning Scheme**\n5. **Add Certificate**(s)\n6. Click **Build My App**\n\n![Secure Certificate Pinning Toggle](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Secure-Certificate-Pinning-toggle.png)\n\n#### Optional Settings:\n\n* [Threat Events](/how-to/application-threat-intelligence/mobile-threat-events/use-appdome-mobile-app-threat-intelligence/)\n* Certificate [**Pinning Mismatch Message**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/notify-users-ssl-tls-certificate-mismatch-detected)\n\n**Congratulations!** You now have a mobile app secured with **Certificate Pinning**.\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec, and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps with **Secure Certificate Pinning**. When an Appdome user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\n### No Coding Dependency\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\n## How to Sign & Publish Secured Mobile Apps Built on\u00a0Appdome\n\nAfter successfully securing your app using\u00a0Appdome, there are several available options to complete your project, depending on\u00a0your\u00a0app lifecycle or workflow.

It includes\u00a0how it works and how to access and download the **Certified Secure** certificate as part of DevSecOps and Android and iOS release processes.\n\n## What is Appdome Certified Secure\u2122?\n\n**Certified Secure**\u2122 is Appdome\u2019s automated mobile app security certification service designed to help organizations build security and fraud detection features into mobile apps as part of the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), CI/CD, and DevSecOps processes. Certified Secure generates an instantly available, easily accessible, and understandable certification covering all security features built into Android and iOS apps by Appdome, either via the Appdome product, via Appdome\u2019s DEV APIs, or as part of a customer\u2019s SDLC, CI/CD and build process. Certified Secure allows organizations to validate and audit exactly which security and fraud detection features were implemented in Android and iOS applications, trace which app(s) have been secured, determine which user created the secured build, and more. Specifically, Certified Secure is designed to allow customers to:\n\n* Internally validate security, fraud detection, and internal and industry compliance objectives, build by build.\n* Speed release processes by using the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate in the app release processes (i.e., verify security in apps before publication to public app stores as part of \u2018go/no-go\u2019 app release meetings.).\n* Verify that Android and iOS apps, app product lines, and app builds include universal standards of security and fraud detection, release by release.\n* Reduce or eliminate release blockers discovered by app scanning, code scanning, pen testing, and other services.\n\nAppdome\u2019s Certified Secure\u2122 eliminates the guesswork in security releases. It provides instant verification of security readiness to release teams, eliminating a dependency on app scanning, pen tests, or other vulnerability assessments at the end of the process (when it is typically too late to act on the results).\n\n## Prerequisites For Using Certify Secure Android and iOS Apps\n\nIn order to download a Certified Secure certificate, you\u2019ll need to protect your app using Appdome\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* A license to Appdome **Certified Secure**\u2122 (separate license required. If you don\u2019t have a license, contact us at [support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com))\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## What\u2019s in the Certified **Secure**\u2122 Mobile App Security Certification?\n\nEach Certified Secure certificate is designed to provide documented evidence of each secured build created on Appdome. The sections below illustrate each component of the Certified Secure Certificate and provide details of what\u2019s included in each certificate.\n\n**![Appdome Certified Secure ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CERT.png)**\n\n1. Quick View Protection Summary\n2. App-Specific Security Attestation-Certification\n3. Complete Build History\n4. Security Template in Use\n5. Android & iOS Security Details\n6. Advanced Enforcement Options\n7. Context/App-specific Configuration\n8. App-Signing Details\n\nCertified Secure certificates are generated each time an Appdome user creates a secure version of an Android or iOS mobile app on Appdome. The certificate can be accessed directly from the user\u2019s account on the Appdome platform or via the confirmation email sent to the user after each secure build is created on Appdome. Each certificate is specific to the app, version, build, and user.\n\n### Certified Secure\u2122 Android and iOS App Details\n\nEach Certified Secure\u2122 certification includes a description of the mobile application secured on Appdome, including:\n\n![App Name And Icon](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-name-and-icon.png)\n\n* App Icon\n* App Name\n* App Version\n* App Dev

Obfuscation\n* TOTALData\u2122 Encryption\n* OS Integrity\n* Mobile Privacy\n* Secure Communication\n* Mobile Malware Prevention\n* Mobile Privacy Prevention\n* Mobile Fraud Detection\n\nThis provides app-release and security teams quick verification that the target application meets the mobile app security and anti-fraud objectives before each release.\n\n### App-Specific Security

Set](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/freeze-fusion-set-security-templates/)\u00a0is enabled\n\nThis provides Appdome\u2019s guarantee that the target build meets the mobile app security and anti-fraud objectives as of the date of the certification.\n\n### Complete Build History\n\nEach Certified Secure\u2122 certification includes the complete build history of the protected Android and iOS app on Appdome, as follows:  \n![App Added Details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Added-Details.png)\n\n* Who uploaded the app\n* Date and

template, called a Fusion Set\u2122, used to protect the Android and iOS app, as follows:\n\n![App Secured](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/App-Secured.png)\n\n* Appdome API or GUI\n* Name of [Fusion Set](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/build-security-template-android-ios-apps/)\n* Fusion Set ID\n* Last modified by\n* OS Platform (Appdome OS support policy)\n* Security Size Impact (increase in App size from security features implemented in the app)\n\nDev and release teams can manage security templates by release, by app(s), or by platform and trace security for apps back to specific templates placed in use at any point in the lifecycle of the app.\n\n### Android & iOS Security Plugin/Parameter Details\n\nEach Certified Secure\u2122 certification includes a complete list of security plugins and parameters chosen by the Appdome user and built into the application by the Appdome

The error specifies that the UIUserInterfaceStyle key must be set to Light, Dark, or Automatic. However, if this setting is correct, the error also indicates that Appdome Diagnostic Logs are still enabled within the app.\n\n## How Does Appdome Protect Mobile Apps from it?\n\nAppdome is committed to ensuring the highest security standards, which includes preventing the upload of apps with diagnostic logs that could expose sensitive information. When this error is encountered, it highlights the need to adhere to security best practices by disabling diagnostic logs.\n\nTo resolve this error, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Remove or disable diagnostic logs**: Before uploading, ensure all Appdome diagnostic logs are disabled or removed from the app. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining security and compliance.\n2. **Rebuild the app**: After the logs have been removed or disabled, rebuild your app package to ensure all changes are applied.\n3. **Attempt to upload again**: Once the changes have been made, use the appropriate tool or service to upload your app to the Apple App Store.\n\nRemoving diagnostic logs not only addresses the ITMS-90785 error but also protects your app from potential vulnerabilities related to data exposure.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Auto Publish Secured iOS Apps to Apple App Store](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/auto-publish-secured-ios-apps-to-apple-app-store/)\n* [How to Auto Publish Secured Android Apps to Google Play](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/auto-publish-secured-android-apps-to-google-play/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.6.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.6.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)!

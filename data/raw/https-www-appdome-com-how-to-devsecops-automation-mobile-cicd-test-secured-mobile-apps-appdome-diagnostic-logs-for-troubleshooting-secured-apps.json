This knowledge base article explains how to use Appdome Diagnostic Logs for troubleshooting secured apps. We strongly suggest not to turn it on without contacting us first as this might affect your application performance.\n\n## Appdome Auto Diagnostics Logs for Troubleshooting Secured Apps\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec, and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding. When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nUsers can build their apps with diagnostic logs turned on and use Appdome Diagnostics Logs for troubleshooting their secured apps.\n\nTo safeguard the integrity of Appdome\u2019s protection mechanisms, all diagnostic logs are encrypted, rendering them indecipherable to unauthorized parties. When submitted to our support team, we securely decrypt and analyze them to swiftly diagnose and resolve any issues.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome Diagnostic Logs\n\nIn order to extract diagnostic app logs from your device, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/) (Check with Appdome Support to verify your account can enable diagnostic logs)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n\n### How to Use Appdome Diagnostic Logs for Troubleshooting Secured Apps\n\nWhen configuring your Fused app with Appdome you\u2019ll find the troubleshooting section at the very bottom of the page.  \nActivate the **Diagnostic Logs**\u00a0toggle, then continue Building your app.  \nThe **Diagnostic Logs**\u00a0toggle adds diagnostic logging to your device console log.

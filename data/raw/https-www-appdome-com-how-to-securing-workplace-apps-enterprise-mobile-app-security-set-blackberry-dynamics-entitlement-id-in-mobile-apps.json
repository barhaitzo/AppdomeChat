Some apps do not conform to these regulations and may have issues when uploading and deploying them via the UEM servers. This Knowledge Base article provides helpful tips,\u00a0 tricks, and recommended best practices on how to set BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID in mobile apps.\n\nWe hope you find it useful and enjoy using Appdome.\n\n## How to Set BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID in Mobile Apps\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there is no requirement to implement the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK\u00a0 or change the application version or bundle identifier for altering the BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID and Entitlement Version for Android or iOS apps. Using Appdome, mobile apps will have the BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID and Entitlement Version capabilities as if they were natively coded into the app.\n\n### Prerequisites for changing an apps BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement:\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no-code integration with BlackBerry Good SDK, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* BlackBerry Good UEM server\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\nEvery app has a bundle ID and bundle version. The app bundle ID is a string usually resembling a reverse domain like\u00a0*com.appdome.awesomeapp.mobile*. The app bundle version is usually in a dotted segment form like *1.0.1.20*.\n\nWhen building an app with the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK, you are required to enter a GD App ID and GD App Version (now called the BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID and BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement Version). In some cases, the app bundle ID and version can be the same as the BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID and Version,\u00a0but this depends on whether the app is built in-house, or if it is an app from an Independent Software Vendor (ISV). The app you are Building on Appdome can be built with any tool such as xCode for iOS and Android Studio using any mobile development frameworks such as Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native.\n\n## The Easy Steps to Set BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID in Mobile Apps\n\nThese values can be edited while Building an App on Appdome under the Management tab after you select BlackBerry SDK as you EMM Service and edit the **GD Entitlement ID** and **GD Entitlement Version**:\n\nClick\u00a0**Management**\u00a0under the\u00a0**Build**\u00a0tab.  \nThen, find\u00a0**EMM Services**\u00a0under the\u00a0**Enterprise Mobility Management**\u00a0heading.\n\n1. Enable or turn \u201cON\u201d\u00a0**EMM Services**and open the drop-down list.\n2. Next,\u00a0choose**BlackBerry Dynamic SDK**\u00a0from the drop-down list.\n3. Change the App Bundle ID (optional).\n4. Change the App Version (optional).\n5. You can use the match BB Entitlement Version and BB Entitlement ID with the application\u2019s bundle identifier and bundle version. This will, in fact, change the application to be a different application. Some applications are not suitable for this change. For most apps this is required for touch ID authentication within the BB Dynamics SDK\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Presentation5-4.png)\n\nBlackBerry has a great guide explaining the BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID and Version here\u00a0[BlackBerry Dynamics SDK Dev Guide](https://developers.blackberry.com/us/en/resources/get-started/blackberry-dynamics-getting-started.html#step-1).\n\nThe GD App ID for an app must be Exclusive. If you are not the exclusive distributor of the app, you must change the app bundle-id to a unique one. Otherwise, you may encounter problems when you will try to provision the Blackberry Good policy on your secure app.\n\n**Please make sure the bundle-id you are using is unique.**\n\nFor example, Cisco Jabber has an app bundle ID: *com.cisco.jabberIM*. When a user imports an app into BlackBerry Dynamics Good Control or UEM, the BlackBerry Entitlement ID for an app must be unique in the world. Appdome lets you change the GD App ID (BlackBerry Entitlement ID) while Building before uploading the app to Good Control or UEM. This will ensure there are no conflicts.\n\nFor example, when Building the Cisco Jabber app, a new GD App ID was entered to ensure it is unique in the world. In this case *com.appdome.jabberim*\u00a0is used as shown below (1). The GD App ID is just a name to identify the app in Good Control or UEM, so you can use any name you like. By using the reverse domain prefix *com.appdome* in this example, this app should not conflict with apps uploaded by any other organization or company. That is, no other company should be using *com.appdome*.\n\n***Note**, the GD App ID must be below 32 characters, it cannot have uppercase letters, and it cannot have special characters. Appdome will automatically correct uppercase letters to lowercase if uppercase letters are entered for the BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement ID.*\n\nOptionally you can change the GD App Version (BlackBerry Dynamics Entitlement Version).  \nThe GD App Version may contain only digits and dots. It can have 4 or less\u00a0segments of 4 or less numbers separated by dots. \u00a0Leading zeros are not allowed.\n\n**Allowed:** 1.22.3.333 or 10.22.0.233 or 1.2323.4321.23\n\n**Not allowed:** 1.02.3.33 or 10.22(mdm).1.2 or 1.2.3.4.5\n\n***Note:****You cannot use letters and you must use numeric digits.*\n\nFor more information on [Appdome for BlackBerry please visit this resource](/enterprise-mobile-apps/enterprise-mobility/blackberry-dynamics/).\n\nTo zoom out on this topic, visit \u00a0Appdome for [Enterprise Mobility](/enterprise-mobile-apps/uem-mam-sdks/mobility-control/) on our website.\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nAppdome provides\u00a0additional\u00a0alternatives for\u00a0[No Code Microsoft Authentication in Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/enterprise-mobile-apps/mobile-iam/microsoft-identity/).\u00a0\u00a0Appdome also has other no code implementations for\u00a0MicroVPN\u00a0and\u00a0[enterprise mobility](https://www.appdome.com/enterprise-mobile-apps/uem-mam-sdks/enterprise-mobility/),\u00a0all of which can be combined with Modern Authentication on Appdome.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

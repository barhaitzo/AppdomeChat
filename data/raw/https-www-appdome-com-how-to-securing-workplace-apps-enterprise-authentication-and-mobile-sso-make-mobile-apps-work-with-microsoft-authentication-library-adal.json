Mobile apps that are not created by Microsoft typically support other authentication methods, not ADAL.\u00a0Using the MicrosoftADAL-OAuth 2.0 framework in non-Microsoft mobile apps is complex. These applications need a way to share authentication state based on\u00a0tokens received by\u00a0Microsoft Outlook or the Microsoft Authenticator application.\n\nMicrosoft ADAL offers two modes of authentication: (1) **direct authentication** \u2013 where the user is directed to an\u00a0Authentication Authority page,\u00a0 and (2) **Brokered Authentication** \u2013 where the user would also have an authenticator application installed. The authenticator handles a shared authentication for all the applications that need to authenticate.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the Single-Sign-On flow for apps that have been integrated with Microsoft ADAL.  \n*Note: The flow is similar for direct and brokered authentication.*\n\n1. The application sends an unauthorized request to reach a resource like internal.mycomp.com which is protected by a gateway, AD, or the app server itself.\n2. The server protecting the resource responds with 401 or 30X response since the request is not authorized.\n3. Appdome identifies the response for the protected resource and opens an internal Webview within the Built App.\n4. The internal Webview is opened to the ADAL Hub URL (For example:\u00a0 myadal.com.com).\n5. The user can now authenticate using any authentication method the hub URL requires, during the authorization session, the cookies and authorization token are received.\n6. The Azure server redirects to the successful URI (e.g. mycomp://authorized) since the authorization succeeded. Note that the app\u2019s Success URI is configured on Azure should match the configuration during fusion.\n7. Appdome identifies the successful URI redirect and closes the internal Webview, thus returning the view to the original app.\n8. Now, when the app tries to reach the protected resource, the authorization header or cookies are attached to the outgoing request. The gateway will trust these credentials and the app will reach the protected resource successfully.\n\n![adding adal to ios and android apps ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-31-10.33.08.png)\n\n### \n\n## Adding Microsoft ADAL to Mobile Apps Fast\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features and 3rd party services like Microsoft ADFS to Android and iOS apps without coding. \u00a0This KB shows mobile developers,\u00a0DevSec\u00a0and security professionals how to use\u00a0Appdome\u2019s simple \u2018click to build\u2019 user interface to quickly and easily make mobile apps work with Microsoft authentication.\u00a0\n\nUsing Appdome, mobile apps will use Microsoft ADAL SSO to authenticate users as if ADAL was natively coded to the app. Appdome for ADAL\u00a0 SSO is compatible with mobile apps built in any development environment including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps and non-native apps built in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic and more. This streamlines implementations, cuts development work, and ensures a guaranteed and consistent integration of Microsoft ADAL SSO to any mobile app.\n\nLog in to your Microsoft Azure portal and retrieve the Azure Client ID. If you have not yet registered an application in Azure AD, you can see [How to Register Apps in Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-identity/make-mobile-apps-work-azure-ad-authentication/).\n\n## How to add Microsoft ADAL SSO to Any Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAppdome makes using Microsoft ADAL in mobile apps easy. Simply upload an Android or iOS application to Appdome, select Microsoft ADAL and click \u201cBuild My App.\u201d Below is a step-by-step guide to completing a full integration of Microsoft ADAL in mobile apps on Appdome.\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add Microsoft Adal SSO to any mobile app:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to [add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n### From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add Microsoft ADAL SSO\n\n1. Select the\u00a0**Build**tab**.***Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*\n2. Select the\u00a0**Authentication**category.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n3. Enable **Authentication Profiles**\n4. Select **Microsoft Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)** from the drop-down menu.\n5. You can add\u00a0specific URLs to apply the authentication to, or leave \u201call\u201d to apply to all URLs accessed by the app.\n6. Enter the URL for your **ADAL Authority**\n7. Enter the URI for **Redirect URI**\n8. Enter the **Client ID** for the app (in Azure sometimes also called Application ID)\n9. Optionally toggle \u201cON\u201d\u00a0\u00a0**Validate Authority**\n10. Optionally\u00a0toggle \u201cON\u201d\u00a0 **Brokered Authentication**\n11. Click **Build My App**\n\n![Make Mobile Apps Work with Microsoft Authentication Library (ADAL)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation1-8.png)\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each application and match the application to the relevant code-sets needed to add Microsoft ADAL SSO to the mobile app in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!** You now have a mobile app fully integrated with Microsoft ADAL SSO.\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\n\u2026\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome for Microsoft ADAL SSO\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of Microsoft ADAL SSO on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk for Android)\n* Azure Hub URL\n* Authentication Successful URI for Native App\n* Azure URIs for protected resources\n* Azure Client ID (Application id)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n### No Coding Dependency\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\n## How to Sign & Publish\u00a0Secured Mobile Apps Built on\u00a0Appdome\n\nAfter successfully building your app using Appdome, there are several available options to complete your project, depending on\u00a0your\u00a0app lifecycle or workflow.

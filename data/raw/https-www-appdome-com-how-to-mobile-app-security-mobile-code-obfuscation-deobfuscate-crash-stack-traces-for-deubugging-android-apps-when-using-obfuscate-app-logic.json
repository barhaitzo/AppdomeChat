This happens because the classes in the crash stack trace are obfuscated.\n\nHere is an example of a crash stack trace generated by a crash of a sample application called CrashTester. As shown below, it is impossible to understand the class from which the crash originated.  \n![Initial Crashstack](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Initial_CrashStack-650x141.png)  \nAfter running Appdome\u2019s deobfuscation tool, the stack trace displays the correct classes of the application:\n\n![Updated Crashstack](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Updated_Crashstack-650x151.png)\n\n## How to get Appdome\u2019s Deobfuscation Tool for Deobfuscating Android Crash Reports\n\nTo get the deobfuscation tool for your fused app:\n\n1. Build an Appdome app with the Obfuscate App Logic feature turned on.![Obfuscate App Logic option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/toggle-2.png)\n2. After completing the entire build, click **Workflow Summary**.![Workflow summary](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WorkflowSummary-650x145.png)\n3. Click **Download Obfuscation Mapping Files** to download the Deobfuscation tool.  \n   ![Download Mapping Files](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2024-04-08-at-17.17.30.png)\n\n## How to use Appdome\u2019s Deobfuscation Tool on your App Reports to Deobfuscate Stack Traces in Android Apps\n\nThe deobfuscation files downloaded from the Workflow Summary contain the following files:\n\n* **deobfuscate\\_mapping\\_script\\_<task\\_id>.py**This is a Python script that will automatically deobfuscate all obfuscated references in logcat logs from the specific Task ID of the app build.  \n  Usage: **python deobfuscate\\_mapping\\_script\\_<task\\_id>.py -f <path\\_to\\_obfuscated\\_log>**\n* **mapping.****txt**\n\n  A file containing a dictionary of the obfuscation names translation.  \n  A mapping file in the same format of ProGuard and R8 format can be uploaded to the Google PlayStore, Crashlytics, Bugsnag, etc.\n* **unobfuscated\\_mapping.****json**\n\n  A JSON file that contains the reasons for the names that were not obfuscated.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Remove Debug Information, Anti-Reversing Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-code-obfuscation/remove-debug-information-anti-reversing-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How to Optimize File Size, Code Obfuscation Best Practices in Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-code-obfuscation/optimize-file-size-code-obfuscation-best-practices-in-android-ios-apps/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.f7b44dd7e2a2333d92cd2e27bb6333a3.1679315985172.1679906843577.1680510329694.12&__hssc=267077713.9.1680510329694&__hsfp=1707508022)!

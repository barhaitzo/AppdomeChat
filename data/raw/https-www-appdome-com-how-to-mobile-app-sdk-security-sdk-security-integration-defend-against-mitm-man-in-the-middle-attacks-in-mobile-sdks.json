Attackers intercept, eavesdrop, and can alter or inject malicious content into the data stream. Common techniques include:\n\n* **Interception via Malicious Proxies:** Unauthorized interception of data sent to and from the SDK.\n* **Monitoring:** Observing data exchanges to capture sensitive information like keys or operational data.\n* **Modification:** Altering transmitted data, potentially injecting harmful code.\n* **Impersonation:** Posing as a legitimate participant in the data exchange to extract data or inject malicious payloads.\n\n### Why is MitM Defense Crucial for Mobile SDKs?\n\nSDKs form the backbone of numerous mobile applications. A single vulnerability can lead to widespread security breaches across all apps utilizing the compromised SDK. Implementing MitM defense mechanisms in SDKs not only secures the SDK but also enhances the security of all dependent applications.\n\nAppdome\u2019s SDK MitM Defense ensures that connections initiated by the mobile SDK are secure and immune to interception and manipulation. This feature is vital for preserving the integrity and confidentiality of the data handled by the SDK and for maintaining the trust of the developers and end-users relying on mobile applications.\n\n### Implementing SDK MitM Defense on Appdome\n\nAppdome offers a robust solution to shield your mobile SDKs from MitM attacks. Key components of this feature include:\n\n* **Secure Certificate Pinning:** Securely stores the certi\ufb01cate(s) of known trusted servers in the SDK and validates the authenticity of the certi\ufb01cate before the connection is established.\n  + **Chain Evaluation:** Ensures the entire certificate chain is trusted and matches the predefined chain.\n  + **Public Key Evaluation:** Validates that the public key in the server\u2019s certificate matches the pre-loaded key in the SDK.\n* **Validate Certificate Chain \u2013** Validates the authenticity of the SSL certificate used by the destination server.\n* **iOS Only \u2013 Block Non-SSL Connections** \u2013 Detects non-SSL/TLS connections as they are untrusted.\n* **iOS Only \u2013 Block Connection on Any Threat \u2013**Block network connection for specified domains on any threat detection.\n* **Root CA Certificate Upload:** Developers can upload a trusted root CA certificate to Appdome, which the SDK will use to verify any server certificates during TLS handshakes.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using SDK MitM Defense with Appdome SDKProtect\u2122\n\nBefore starting the process of securing your SDK with Appdome, ensure you have the following:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **SDK MitM Defense**\n* A valid **.aar file or xcframework.zip file-**\u00a0Confirm your SDK is in one of these formats, which are standard for Android and iOS development.\n\n## Steps to Enable SDK MitM Defense via Appdome Console\n\n**Note:** This example uses a .aar SDK file. You can also apply the SDK MitM Defense feature to iOS SDKs using the xcframework.zip format.\n\nOn Appdome, follow these\u00a0**simple steps**\u00a0to secure Android SDKs:\n\n1. [**Upload**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1720706029100.1720941324560.53&__hssc=79098507.9.1720941324560&__hsfp=2459653256)\u00a0the Mobile SDK to Appdome.\n   * **Upload Method:**\u00a0Appdome Console or DEV-API\n   * **Android Formats:**\u00a0.aar\n   * **iOS Formats:** xcframework.zip file\n2. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the SDK MitM Defense feature as shown below:  \n   ![Fusion Set Sdk Mitm Defense](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fusion-Set-SDK-MiTM-Defense.png)\n3. When you enable SDK Threat-Shielding, the Fusion Set you created now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Encrypt SDK Preferences.  \n   ![Saved Fusion Set Sdk Mitm Defense](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saved-Fusion-Set-SDK-MiTM-Defense.png)\n4. To copy the Fusion Set ID, open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c\u2026\u201d symbol at the far right corner of the Fusion Set.  \n   ![Copy Fs Id](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/copy_fs_id.png)\n5. Toggle on the SDK MitM Defense feature.\n   * **Where:** Inside the Appdome Console, go to\u00a0**Build SDKProtect\u2122** >\u00a0**SDK Threat-Shielding**\u00a0section.\n   * **How:** Toggle on the SDK Threat-Shielding feature.\n   * Toggle on SDK MitM Defense\n6. Specify one or more hostnames using standard wildcards to define the SDK domain you would like to protect.\n7. Select a Pinning Scheme, either Chain Evaluation or Public Key Evaluation\n8. Upload Root CA Public Certificate or a certificate chain or a Server Pinned certificate as a file or a zip (.cer, .crt, .pem, .der, .zip).  \n   **ANDROID**  \n   ![Android Sdk Mitm Defense](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Android-SDK-MiTM-Defense.png)**iOS  \n   ![Ios Sdk Mitm Defense](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iOS-SDK-MiTM-Defense-1.png)**\n9. Turn on Threat Events for SDK MitM Defense\n\n   * **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > In-App Detection**When this setting is used, Appdome detects if the application is capable of modifying its binary at runtime to avoid detection and passes Appdome\u2019s Threat-Event\u2122 attack intelligence to the app\u2019s business logic for processing, enforcement, and user notification. For more information on consuming and using Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 in the app, see the section Using Threat-Events\u2122 for SDK MitM Defense in Mobile Apps.\n   * **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > Enforce Connection Only**When Appdome detects a security event, it passes the event from the Appdome layer to the app and blocks the connection that triggered the event. By design, when the mobile application registers to receive Appdome Threat Events, Appdome will send an initial event. If Appdome detects a security event during the app launch/run, the initial event will hold the triggered security event details. If no security event is triggered, the initial event will only indicate a successful registration to Appdome Threat-Events (the event fields will hold no data).\n10.

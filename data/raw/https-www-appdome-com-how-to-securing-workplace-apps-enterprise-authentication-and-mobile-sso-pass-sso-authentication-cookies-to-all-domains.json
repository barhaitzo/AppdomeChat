In cases when the authentication domain is different than that of the protected resource \u2013 tokens might not be associated with the protected resource.  \nApplications might, in several scenarios, need the ability to propagate authentication cookies to all domains.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for using Appdome to propagate SSO cookies to all domains within any Android and iOS mobile app.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Pass SSO Authentication Cookies To All Domains\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect or any other authentication standard inside the app. The Appdome technology can propagate SSO cookies to all domains and more to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all. Using Appdome, mobile apps will be able to propagate SSO cookies as if it was natively coded to the app.\n\nAs part of defining the organization\u2019s authentication infrastructure, you would like to protect certain resources that mobile apps might need to use and limit the access to those resources by having the user authenticate with one of the SSO providers or supported protocols. The application then needs to go through authentication when it tries to access a protected resource. After authenticating the application receives a token with which it can authenticate further, without the need for user interaction, until the token expires. This means that after authentication, the token needs to be passed along with requests the Application makes for the resource.\n\nAppdome allows you to easily choose the authentication provider/scheme and define which resources should be protected. Once the application is built the authenticator will be activated automatically when needed and the token will be managed by Appdome and passed to requests as needed. Furthermore, Appdome will automatically recognize when the token has expired and will require authentication again.\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code\u00a0Cookies Groups\u00a0on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Choose an authentication provider of the supported providers or use Mobile Enterprise Authentication by Appdome. To learn more about the supported services please visit [Appdome for Single Sign On\u00a0knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-mobile-sso/use-enterprise-authentication-mobile-apps/).\n\n## 4 Easy Steps to Pass SSO Authentication Cookies To All Domains\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add\u00a0Cookies Groups\u00a0to any mobile Application:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to [add a mobile apps to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n### From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add\u00a0Cookies Groups\n\nSelect the **Build\u00a0Tab**.\u00a0*Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*\n\nBeneath the Build Tab, you will find several service options. Select **Authentication**.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n\n1. Configure your desired SSO provider as described in\u00a0[Appdome for Single Sign-on](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-mobile-sso/use-enterprise-authentication-mobile-apps/)\n2. Open the Scheme drop-down list named **Advanced Settings**\n3. In the Advanced Settings, add domains to the\u00a0**Cookies Groups**list\n\n![propagating SSO cookies in mobile apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation16.png)\n\n4. When finished, click\u00a0**Build My App.**\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each application and match the application to the relevant code-sets needed to add\u00a0Cookies Groups to the mobile app in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!** You now have a mobile app fully integrated with Cookies Groups.\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\n## **After Adding\u00a0Cookies Groups to a Mobile App on Appdome**\n\nAfter you have addedCookies Group so any mobile app on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built Application\n\nAppdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the application, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the application.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps ).\n\n### Sign the Appdome-Built Application (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-built app, it must be signed.\u00a0[Signing iOS app](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/) and[Signing an Android app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) are easy using Appdome.

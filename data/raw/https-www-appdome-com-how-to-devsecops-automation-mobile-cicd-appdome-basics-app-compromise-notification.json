When Appdome identifies a threat, it responds based on the policy provided by the customer. The policy can specify that when a specific event is detected, the app will trigger an app compromise notification to the user.\n\nThe content of the notification is specified below the specific threat in the **App Compromise Notification** field. A default message will be displayed if the customer does not provide the notification content. However, we advise customers to provide the notification content by specifying an easy-to-follow default remediation path for the mobile app end user. You can customize this message as required to achieve brand-specific support, workflow, or other messaging. For example, you can use the tag **{app\\_display\\_name}**\u00a0which will be replaced with the app display name when the notification is displayed.\n\nThe event code and the app fuse token are added to the message in the following format:\n\n`REF: [event code]:[fuse id]:[threat code]:[message content]`\n\nApp Compromise Notification field\n\n[![App Compromise](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/App_Compromise.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/App_Compromise.png)\n\nThe **App Compromise Notification** field is displayed differently in iOS and Android, as shown below.\n\n* A toast message on Android devices  \n  ![Toast On Android App compromise notification](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Toast-on-Android-AppCompromiseNotification-174x366.png)\n* A popup notification on IOS devices  \n  ![Pop-up On iOS App compromise notification](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Popup-on-iOS-AppCompromiseNotification-172x366.png)\n\n### Short Message Option\n\nOn Android devices with OS version Android 12 and above, the content length of Toast messages is limited. Appdome allows you to select an alternative message with a shorter description under the **Short Compromised Notice** field.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The number of characters shown in the short compromise notification messages depends on factors such as the device, Android OS version, and device settings, which are all controlled by the Android OS and unrelated to Appdome. To ensure optimal readability across different devices and screen sizes, we advise keeping the text of the short message notifications as concise as possible.\n\n[![App Compromise Short](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/App_Compromise_Short.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/App_Compromise_Short.png)\n\nThe event code and the app fuse token are added to the message in the following format:  \n`REF: [event code]:[fuse id]:[threat code]:[message content]`  \nWhile Appdome does its best to display the full compromise notification message, the short message is used as a fallback.\n\nOn iOS devices, there is no such limitation, and the full compromise notification message will be used.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use Localized Messages to Display App Compromise Notifications in Different Languages](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appdome-basics/use-localized-messages-to-display-app-compromise-notifications-in-different-languages/)\n* [How to Use ThreatScope\u2122 User Remediation Center](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-threat-intelligence-center/remediation-center/)\n* [How to Understand Appdome Version Numbering](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/breakdown-of-appdome-version-number/)\n\n## Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1679322760586.1679391001880.3&__hssc=267077713.3.1679391001880&__hsfp=2327634395)!

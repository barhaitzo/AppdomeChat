It does this by submitting a characteristic identification string to its operating peer by what is commonly known as the User-Agent header.\n\n## How to Use a Mobile App\u2019s User-Agent for Secure NAC\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on networking APIs. The Appdome technology edits the HTTP User-Agent Header adds relevant standards, frameworks and more to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all. Using Appdome, mobile apps will use User Agent to send the custom-tailored User-Agent header which you require.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome to Change the User-Agent Header\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of User-Agent Header, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher.\n* [Appdome Built App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/using-no-code-security-android-ios-apps/)\n* The desired User-Agent Header\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## 5 Easy Steps to Use a Mobile App\u2019s User-Agent for Secure NAC\n\n**Upload a Mobile App to Your Account**\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app\u00a0to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).\n\nSelect the\u00a0**Build Tab**.\u00a0*Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*Beneath the Build Tab, select\u00a0**Access**.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n\n1. 1. Open\u00a0Appdome **Access** Category\n   2. Expand the sub-category Private Server Certificate and Authorities\n   3. Enable or toggle \u201cON\u201d\u00a0**User-Agent**\n   4. Enter the new **User-Agent Header**\n   5. Click **Build** **My App**\n\n![Changing the User-Agent Header in any iOS or Android app without source code ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation1-13-1.png)\n\nThe technology behind Appdome has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to customize your mobile app in seconds. For example, changing the User-Agent in HTML headers for the app\u2019s requests.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0When Appdome completes your requested integration, you\u2019ll see the notice below. You now have a mobile app fully integrated with\u00a0User-Agent\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\n### What\u2019s next after changing the User-Agent Header in your app?\n\n1. Sign the User-Agent enabled Appdome-Built App\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-Built app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/) and [Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n2. Deploy the Appdome-Built App to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Built apps, please read\u00a0[this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\nThat\u2019s it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome User Agent in your app!\n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [How to Achieve Secure Remote Mobile App Access with MicroVPN](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-workplace-apps/mobile-enterprise-access-and-microvpn/achieve-secure-remote-mobile-app-access-with-microvpn/)\n* [How to Add Proxy PAC Routing to Enterprise Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-workplace-apps/mobile-enterprise-access-and-microvpn/add-proxy-pac-routing-to-enterprise-mobile-apps/)\n* [How to Validate SSO Configurations in Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-workplace-apps/enterprise-authentication-and-mobile-sso/validate-sso-configurations-in-mobile-apps/)\n\nLast updated May 2\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nFor more on this topic, visit\u00a0[App Branding on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps/) on our website.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

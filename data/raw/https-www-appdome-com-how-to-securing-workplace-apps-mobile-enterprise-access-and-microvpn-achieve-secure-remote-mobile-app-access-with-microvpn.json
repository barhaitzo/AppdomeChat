The purpose of using a MicroVPN in mobile apps is to enable Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and avoid deploying a VPN client to every device. MicroVPNs allow mobile apps to establish direct and seamless access to corporate resources without a VPN on the device. This Knowledge Base explains how anyone can use Appdome to achieve secure remote mobile access with MicroVPN.\n\n## How to Achieve Secure Remote Mobile App Access with MicroVPN\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nAppdome MicroVPN is a flexible, all-in-one, mobile enterprise connectivity solution that supports any enterprise standard network gateway such as an SSL gateway, proxy, reverse proxy, or industry standard VPN. Appdome MicroVPN eliminates the need for mobile device VPNs or per application VPNs. Using Appdome MicroVPN each mobile app connects directly and securely to enterprise infrastructures.\n\nAppdome\u2019s MicroVPN does not require all web service endpoints to be published via a gateway or code change to apps to repoint to the newly published addresses of services. Appdome\u2019s MicroVPN can use any SSL gateway, including Microsoft App Proxy, Netscaler and more in two main modes: transparent mode which does not require resources to be publicly published, and reverse proxy mode which is intended for publicly resolvable resources. Modes can also be set on a per resource basis, providing full granular control over the access and connectively model.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement. Likewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on having standard or proprietary VPN protocols inside the mobile apps. The Appdome technology adds MicroVPN and relevant standards, protocols and more to the mobile app automatically.\n\n### Appdome for Mobile MicroVPN offers two modes:\n\nOn Appdome, you can enable a mobile app to use MicroVPN in two different modes of operation:\n\n1. **Direct Connection Mode (default)**  \n   In this mode, the Appdome MicroVPN layer will act as a secure gateway between the application and the world. Inside the Appdome-Built application, the original application connects to the Appdome MicroVPN layer. This internal connection is protected by Appdome Security and not visible to the outside world. The Appdome MicroVPN Layer connects securely to the corporate gateway. The Appdome MicroVPN layer authenticates to the corporate gateway, enabling secure mobile app access to internal resources.\n2. **Transparent Proxy Mode:**  \n   In this mode, the Appdome MicroVPN layer routes its connection request to a proxy server, so that the proxy server can act as the secure gateway. Corporate proxies are typically accessible via the Internet. The Appdome MicroVPN layer tunnels a secure connection to the proxy to allow the original application to privately connect to the corporate network.\n\n### Appdome for Mobile MicroVPN Features:\n\n**Inclusive Routing**\n\nInclusive routing means you can decide that only some domains (regular expressions can be used) are securely connected using MicroVPN, while other connections that are not included in the domain list are allowed to pass directly. This gives you the option to choose particular settings different domains, which is especially useful for defining multiple profiles with different configurations.\n\n**Session Hardening**\n\nThe most straightforward way of ensuring that connections between mobile apps and corporate networks are secure is to restrict the parameters of the connection. Appdome allows you to control two important parts of the connection used by the Appdome MicroVPN layer.\n\n1. **Strict Protocol Checking**, only connections to protocols in a pre-defined list are permitted. This prevents connections from the built application to less secure destinations from being established.\n2. **Server Validation**, after establishing a connection to a destination, the Appdome-fused app can do advanced checks to verify that the destination is who it says it is and is not a fake or malicious destination that impersonates your destination.\n\nWhen **Strict Protocol Checking** is enabled, built apps will only be able to make connections to secure servers using these algorithms:\n\nDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256, DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384, ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256.\n\n**Static Client Pinning**\n\nA more advanced security measure is to apply restrictions on the server or gateway which is the destination for the mobile app. If you set up the server or gateway to only accept connections from clients that can identify themselves using specific client certificates, Appdome can integrate the certificates needed to identify the client and present them as part of the secured connections.\n\n**Dynamic Client Pinning**\n\nDynamic client pinning is an enterprise extension for static client pinning. It allows the use of a unique client-side certificate distributed by a SCEP server on a per-user basis. Currently, users are identified when fusing an app together with MicroVPN and Microsoft [Intune](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/make-mobile-apps-work-intune-microvpn/). For more details read this [article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/use-microsoft-scep-certificates-intune-app-sdk/).\n\n**Profiles**\n\nAppdome allows you to define one or more profiles to configure all the above settings. In this manner, you can protect some domains with Static Client Pinning,\u00a0while protecting others by securing them using Transparent Proxy mode. Note: When using multiple profiles, all the profiles should be set up with Inclusive Routing in order to have the handling of each domain well defined.\n\n### Prerequisites for adding MicroVPN by Appdome\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of MicroVPN on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher.\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Enterprise-grade SSL gateway, proxy, reverse proxy, or industry standard VPN that is the authentication or termination endpoint for the MicroVPN\n* List of internal domains the mobile app will access\n* Client-side certificates (PEM+key) for Static Client Pinning\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## **9 Easy Steps** to Achieve Secure Remote Mobile App Access with MicroVPN\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add MicroVPN to mobile apps on Appdome:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n### From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, select \u201cAccess\u201d category\n\n1.

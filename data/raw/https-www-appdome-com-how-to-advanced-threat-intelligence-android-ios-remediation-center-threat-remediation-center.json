This innovative solution enhances mobile security by dynamically generating a context-specific ThreatCode\u2122 whenever an Appdome-protected mobile app detects a potential threat. This code encapsulates crucial details about the threat, including the attack vector, device specifics, operating system, and other pertinent data\u2014essentially providing a comprehensive DNA profile of each threat encountered on the mobile device.\n\nUpon receiving a ThreatCode, support, engineering, or cybersecurity professionals from mobile brands and enterprises can input this code into the Threat Remediation Center. Here, Appdome\u2019s advanced Threat Remediation Agent\u2122 employs retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to intelligently formulate responses using GenAI, optimizing the solution for the specific attack scenario. This process not only helps pinpoint and understand the nature of the attack but also guides users through detailed steps to mitigate or completely remove the threat from the affected device.\n\n### Benefits\n\n* **Faster Remediations**: GenAI enables support teams to resolve threats quickly and efficiently by providing detailed, actionable information. This reduces downtime and minimizes the impact of cyber attacks on the end user\u2019s mobile experience.\n* **Reduced Support Burden**: Automating the threat remediation process with GenAI alleviates the burden on support centers and cyber teams. This allows these teams to focus on more complex security challenges, improving overall efficiency.\n* **User-Threat Specific Remediations**: GenAI\u2019s ability to tailor its recommendations based on the specific device and OS ensures that users receive the most relevant and practical guidance. This personalized approach enhances the overall security of the mobile ecosystem.\n\n### **To Use the Threat Remediation Center Feature:**\n\n1. Log in to your Appdome account.\n2. Click on the Threat Remediation Center button on the top menu bar. **![Trc1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/trc1-1300x303.jpg)**\n3. Enter the\u00a0**Threat Event Code** as it appears in the notification on the user\u2019s mobile device.  \n   **Note:** The Threat Event Code may consist of either 8 characters or 14 characters.

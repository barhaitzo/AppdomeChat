Many companies are using, or are in the process of migrating from MDMs to MAM and to Microsoft Intune. In addition, organizations often require mobile apps and mobile app users to use secure network connectivity. MicroVPN allows a mobile app to securely connect to any standard SSL, VPN or Proxy enterprise gateway. This Knowledge Base explains how you can use Appdome to make mobile apps work with Intune and MicroVPN in seconds. From there, you can manage any mobile App using Microsoft Intune and secured its network connection.\n\nThanks for reading and we hope you find this article helpful.\n\n## How to Make Mobile Apps Work with Intune and MicroVPN\n\nMobile Apps need network connectivity to communicate with the outside world, including the servers and services needed for the App to function properly. Unfortunately, the public (not secured) networks pose the risk of data loss, data theft, identity theft, and more. Appdome MicroVPN is part of the**Mobile Access**category**.**It is a secure mobile access feature, unique to Appdome, which enables a mobile app to connect directly to any enterprise SSL, VPN, or Proxy gateway in a flexible, efficient, and secure manner.\u00a0\u00a0Note that it\u2019s not truly a VPN (It doesn\u2019t tunnel the connection through a remote server), instead, it\u2019s a component in the application itself that takes care to ensure secure connection parameters.\u00a0 MicroVPN is an industry-standard term.\n\nAppdome\u2019s MicroVPN does not require all web service endpoints to be published via a gateway or code change to apps to repoint to the newly published addresses of services. Appdome\u2019s MicroVPN can use any SSL gateway, including Microsoft App Proxy, Netscaler and more in two main modes: **Transparent\u00a0Proxy mode** which does not require resources to be publicly published, and **Direct Connection mode**\u00a0which is intended for publicly resolvable resources. Modes can also be set on a per-resource basis, providing full granular control over the access and connectively model.\n\nAppdome for Microsoft Intune SDK Integration is one of the premier solutions available on Appdome. Using Appdome to **Build**\u00a0Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN to mobile Apps is simple and fast.\u00a0Once **Build** is complete, you can deploy the Built\u00a0App directly to Intune and install the Built\u00a0App on mobile devices via Intune. All data created within the App will be encrypted and protected inside a container, preventing other applications from accessing the App\u2019s data. Furthermore,\u00a0When the Built App initiates an SSL Handshake with the server, using MicroVPN, outgoing traffic will be processed to ensure the connection to the server is secure.\u00a0 Appdome allows you to enjoy all the features the Microsoft Intune SDK offers as well as the additional\u00a0security of\u00a0[Appdome Mobility Suite](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/guarantee-android-ios-compatibility-uem-mam/)\u00a0and\u00a0[BoostEMMTMby Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/boostemm-by-appdome/).\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement. The iOS (.ipa) or Android (.apk or .aab) App can be built in any development environment such as xCode for iOS and Android Studio, or non-native environments like Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native. Likewise, there is no requirement to pre-build any part of the Microsoft Intune functionality, use the Microsoft wrapper, or implement Microsoft Intune SDK\u00a0capabilities into Android or iOS Apps prior to using Appdome. Appdome\u2019s technology adds the full Microsoft Intune SDK, as well as standards, methods or protocols necessary, to mobile Apps automatically. After using Appdome, mobile Apps will leverage the\u00a0Microsoft Intune SDK\u00a0capabilities as if they were natively coded into the App.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome for Microsoft Intune\n\n1. [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/) \u2013 IDEAL or Higher\n2. [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n3. You have a configured and accessible instance of [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/account-sign-up) (to deploy your App).\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Make Mobile Apps Work with Intune and MicroVPN\n\nTo Build your App with the Microsoft Intune SDK, follow these simple steps.\u00a0 Note, the same workflow can be used for either an Android or iOS App.\n\n### From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add the Microsoft Intune SDK\n\n1. Select the **Build**tab**.***Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*\n2. Select the\u00a0**Management**category.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n3. Toggle \u201cON\u201d\u00a0\u00a0**EMM Services**and **Select the Microsoft Intune SDK**  \n   ![Add Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN to any app using appdome - no coding](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.35.22-PM.png)\n\n### Steps to Integrate MicroVPN\n\n1. Click the **Build**\u00a0tab\n2. Click the **Appdome for****Access** category\n3. Enable**MicroVPN**  \n   ![Add Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN to any app using appdome - no coding](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.41.30-PM.png)\n\n### Configuring the MicroVPN Profile\n\nFor full information regarding the profile configuration please read\u00a0[Adding MicroVPN to Applications](/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/achieve-secure-remote-mobile-app-access-microvpn/)\n\nMicroVPN profile configuration options:\n\n1. **Inclusive Routing** \u2013\u00a0If you want to route specific domains over MicroVPN you can specify the domains under Inclusive Routing.  \n   If you don\u2019t enable Inclusive routing, all communication from the App is hardened.\u00a0If you enable Inclusive Routing, communication to the domains you add will be hardened. All other traffic is permitted.\n   1. **Inclusion List** \u2013 If you enable Inclusive routing, you can add server hosts and domains one line add a time. Wildcards are permitted.\n2. **Transparent Proxy Mode** \u2013 Enable internal DNS resolution as well as a many-to-one relay via the standard Transparent Proxy protocol (HTTP CONNECT)\n   1. **Proxy Host** \u2013 If you enable Transparent Proxy Mode, you will need to specify the hostname of a proxy-relay.\n\n   ![appdome inclusive routing - Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.46.37-PM.png)\n3. **Session Hardening** \u2013 The most straightforward way of ensuring that connections between mobile Apps and corporate networks are secure is to restrict the parameters of the connection by verifying the server certificates and protocols.\n   1. **Strict Protocol Checking** \u2013 When enabled, the Built App is prevented from connecting with un-secure servers.  \n      The Built App can connect only to Secure servers that use these algorithms: DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256, DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384, ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256.\n   2. **Server Validation** \u2013 Actively verify server certificate and trust chain for all connections through the MicroVPN service.\n4. **Static Client Pinning**\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0This pinning allows client-side certificates\u00a0to be added to the Built App for connecting with servers that require them.\n   1. **Custom Certificate .pem File** \u2013 Chose and Upload a client cert to use for authentication. The certificate file name must end in .pem.\n   2. **Custom Certificate .key File** \u2013 Chose and Upload the key for the client certificate. The key file name must end in .key.\n5. **Dynamic Client Pinning** \u2013 Pin a dynamic unique personal client certificate to the Built App to authenticate client connections on the MicroVPN gateway.\n   1. **SCEP Server URL** \u2013 Enter the URL of the Microsoft NDES server.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-3.27.14-PM.png)\n\n### Build your App with Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN\n\nClick \u201c**Build\u00a0My App\u201d**\u00a0to complete Appdome\u2019s Microsoft Intune SDK and the new profiled MicroVPN integration to the App.\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each App and match the App to the relevant code-sets needed to add Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN to the mobile App in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0When your implementation is complete, you\u2019ll see the notice below. You now have a mobile App fully integrated with Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN.\u00a0 The App will be managed by Intune and have the ability to utilize a secure connection to backend corporate services.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-3.42.48-PM.png)\n\n## After Building Your\u00a0App with Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN\n\nAfter you have added\u00a0Microsoft Intune and MicroVPN to your app,\u00a0there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\nPlease view the article here on [How to Complete My Mobile Integration Project After I Build My App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-complete-your-mobile-app-integration-project-after-integrating-your-mobile-app-on-appdome/).\n\nHere\u2019s an article on [How to Automatically Distribute Built Apps to Your Intune Environment.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/auto-publish-secure-enterprise-apps-built-intune/)\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy your newly integrated mobile app!\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nFor full information regarding the profile configuration please read here on [Building Applications with MicroVPN](/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/achieve-secure-remote-mobile-app-access-microvpn/)\n\nTo zoom out on this topic, deploying mobile Apps fused with the Microsoft Intune SDK, read the\u00a0[Appdome for Microsoft Intune datasheet](https://www.appdome.com/enterprise-mobile-apps/enterprise-mobility/microsoft-intune//)on our website.\n\nTo ensure your App is properly deployed with Microsoft Intune, make sure to visit\u00a0[Deploying Mobile Apps Fused with the Microsoft Intune SDK](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/publish-secure-enterprise-apps-built-intune-sdk/).\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

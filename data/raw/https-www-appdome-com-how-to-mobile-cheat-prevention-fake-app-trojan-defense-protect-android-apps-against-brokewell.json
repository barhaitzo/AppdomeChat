Distributed through fake app updates, such as Chrome, Brokewell uses overlay attacks to display fake login screens over legitimate apps, capturing credentials. It also logs keystrokes, captures browser cookies, and records accessibility events like swipes and text inputs. Advanced spyware features, such as recording audio and taking screenshots, enable attackers to gain comprehensive control over the device. With its ability to bypass Android\u2019s security features and adapt to newer versions, Brokewell is a significant threat, requiring robust defenses to prevent fraud, device takeovers, and data breaches.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Against Brokewell Trojan in Android Apps?\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic Detect Brokewell Trojan plugin for Android combines advanced protections for overlay attacks, accessibility service abuse, keyloggers, and screen recording malware. It prevents overlay attacks by detecting and blocking unauthorized overlays, protects against accessibility service abuse, and stops keyloggers from intercepting sensitive inputs. Screen-sharing malware prevention blocks unauthorized screenshots and mirroring. Combined, these protections ensure dynamic and continuous protection against Brokewell\u2019s diverse attack vectors without requiring developers to write or change code. Mobile developers can leverage Appdome\u2019s Threat-Events\u2122 to collect detailed data and implement tailored in-app responses based on detected threats.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against CraxsRAT malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/know-your-customer/protect-android-apps-against-craxsrat/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against Vultur](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/android-malware-detection/protect-android-apps-against-vultur/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against EventBot Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/android-malware-detection/protect-android-apps-against-eventbot-malware/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against FjordPhantom malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/know-your-customer/protect-android-ios-apps-against-fjordphantom/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against Panda malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-cheat-prevention/fake-app-trojan-defense/protect-android-apps-against-panda/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against Brokewell malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-cheat-prevention/fake-app-trojan-defense/protect-android-apps-against-brokewell/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

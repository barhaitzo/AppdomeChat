This allows them to (1) ensure that mobile application workflows are aware of attacks and threats, (2) customize business logic and user experience based on the user\u2019s risk profile and/or each attack or threat presented, and (3) pass the threat data to other systems of record such as app servers, mobile fraud analysis systems, SIEMs, and other data collection points.\n\nThe purpose of Threat-Events is to enable Android and iOS applications to adapt and respond to mobile app attacks and threats in real time. Using Threat-Events will ensure you keep users, data, and transactions safe.\n\n### Mobile Application Threat-Events vs. Threat-Scores\n\nAppdome Threat-Events can be used as a stand-alone implementation in\u00a0MAUI Apps, or in combination with\u00a0Threat-Scores. Threat-Events provide the mobile developer with the in-app notification of each attack or threat, as well as the metadata associated with the attack. Threat-Scores provide the mobile developer with the Threat-Event event score and the combined (aggregated) mobile end-user risk at the time of the notification.\n\nThe figure below shows where you can find Threat-Events and Threat-Scores for each of the runtime mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile antibot, and other protections available on Appdome:\n\n![55](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/55.png)\n\nTo enable Threat-Events with any runtime protection, select the check box next to Threat-Events for that feature. Doing so will enable (turn ON) Threat-Events for that feature. To enable Threat-Scores for any runtime protection, click the up/down arrow associated with Threat-Scores to assign a specific score to each protection.  \nThreat-Scores must have a value greater than zero (0) and less than ten thousand (10,000).\n\nThreat-Events and Threat-Scores can be used with or in place of server-based mobile anti-fraud solutions.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Threat-Events with MAUI Apps\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to use Threat-Events with\u00a0MAUI Apps.\n\n* Appdome account (If you do not yet have an account,\u00a0[**create a free Appdome account**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)).\n* Appdome account class \u2013 Appdome DEV or higher.\n* Mobile Application Source Code.\n* Signing Credentials (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile) \u2013 see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\u00a0and\u00a0[**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/).\n\n### Code Snippet Required for\u00a0Using Threat-Events with MAUI Apps\n\nBefore consuming Threat-Events or Threat-Scores in your MAUI\u00a0Apps, confirm that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Threat-Events and/or Threat-Scores have been enabled (turned ON) for the specific protection\n* You are using the correct identifiers for the Threat-Events for each protection.  \n  You can find the specific identifiers for each Threat-Event and Threat-Score in the knowledge base article associated with each protection.\n\nBelow we provide concise steps and code snippets to help you integrate Threat-Events into your mobile application on both iOS and Android platforms Please follow the platform-specific instructions that best suit your needs, whether it\u2019s iOS or Android.\n\n### Below is the code snippet required for using Threat-Events\u2122 and Threat-Scores\u2122 in Android MAUI Apps:\n\n1. Create a new file by the name **MainApplication.cs** if don\u2019t have an application class in your project already.\n\n* + Add to this file a class that extends\u00a0**Application**\u00a0and implement\u00a0**public MainApplication ():**\n\n```\n[Application]\r\npublic class MainApplication : MauiApplication\r\n{\r\n    public MainApplication(IntPtr javaReference, JniHandleOwnership transfer)\r\n        : base(javaReference, transfer)\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    public override void OnCreate()\r\n    {\r\n        base.OnCreate();\r\n    }\r\n    protected override MauiApp CreateMauiApp() =&gt; MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp();\r\n}\n```\n\n2. Create a new file by the name **ThreatEventReceiver.cs**.\n\n* + Add the following lines to implement the Appdome Android Threat-Events listener:\n\n```\npublic class ThreatEventReceiver : BroadcastReceiver\r\n{\r\n    public override void OnReceive(Context context, Intent intent)\r\n    {\r\n        String message = intent.getStringExtra(\"message\"); // Message shown to the user\r\n        String reasonData = intent.getStringExtra(\"reasonData\"); // Threat detection cause\r\n        String reasonCode = intent.getStringExtra(\"reasonCode\"); // Event reason code\r\n        String currentThreatEventScore = intent.getStringExtra(\"currentThreatEventScore\"); // Current threat event score\r\n        String threatEventsScore = intent.getStringExtra(\"threatEventsScore\"); // Total threat events score\r\n        String variable = intent.getStringExtra(\"<Context Key>\"); // Any other event specific context key\r\n\r\n        // Your logic goes here (Send data to Splunk/Dynatrace/Show Popup...)\r\n    }\r\n}\n```\n\n3. Inside your **cs** file, locate the **OnCreate** method that we mentioned in the previous steps.\n\n* + Within this method, add the following lines to initialize the Threat-Events receiver:\n\n```\npublic override void OnCreate()\r\n{\r\n    base.OnCreate();\r\n    RegisterReceiver(new ThreatEventReceiver(), new IntentFilter(\"EmulatorFound\")); // Threat-Event Identifier\r\n}\n```\n\n### Below is the code snippet required for using Threat-Events\u2122 and Threat-Scores\u2122 in IOS Apps:\n\nIn the file\u00a0**AppDelegate.cs,**add the following lines in the overridden\u00a0**FinishedLaunching**method :\n\n```\npublic override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)\r\n{\r\n    NSNotificationCenter.DefaultCenter.AddObserver(\r\n        (NSString)\"JailbrokenDevice\", // Threat-Event Identifier\r\n        delegate (NSNotification notification)\r\n        {\r\n            var message = notification.UserInfo.ObjectForKey(\"message\"); // Message shown to the user\r\n            var reasonData = notification.UserInfo.ObjectForKey(\"reasonData\"); // Threat detection cause\r\n            var reasonCode = notification.UserInfo.ObjectForKey(\"reasonCode\"); // Event reason code\r\n            var currentThreatEventScore = notification.UserInfo.ObjectForKey(\"currentThreatEventScore\"); // Current threat event score\r\n            var threatEventsScore = notification.UserInfo.ObjectForKey(\"threatEventsScore\"); // Total threat events score\r\n            var variable = notification.UserInfo.ObjectForKey(\"<Context Keys>\"); // Any other event specific context key\r\n\r\n            // Your logic goes here (Send data to Splunk/Dynatrace/Show Popup...)\r\n    });\r\n    return base.FinishedLaunching(app, options);\r\n}\n```\n\n### Special Considerations for using Threat-Events with\u00a0MAUI Apps\n\nMAUI apps leverage the native BroadcastReceiver or NSNotificationsCenter through a C# interface provided by the MAUI framework. Consequently, it\u2019s crucial to implement the appropriate listeners for each platform your app targets.\n\nIn the code examples provided, we\u2019ve used a specific event identifier for demonstration purposes. You can easily replace this identifier with any other event identifier mentioned in the Appdome knowledge base, depending on your unique threat detection and notification requirements. Feel free to customize the event identifier to align with your application\u2019s specific needs and threat-event configurations.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that you have the flexibility to stack multiple listeners for various events, ensuring comprehensive threat detection and response capabilities within your application.\n\nSome or all of the meta-data for each mobile application Threat-Event and Threat-Score can be consumed in MAUI Apps at the discretion of the mobile developer and used, in combination with other mobile application data, to adapt the business logic or user experience when one or more attacks or threats are present.\n\n### Meta-Data for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nBelow is the list of metadata that can be associated with each mobile application Threat-Event\u00a0and Threat-Score\u00a0in\u00a0MAUI Apps.\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| carrierPlmn | PLMN of the device. Only available for Android devices. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| deviceBrand | Brand of the device |\n| deviceBoard | Board of the device |\n| buildUser | Build user |\n| buildHost | Build host |\n| sdkVersion | Sdk version |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n\nSome or all of the meta-data for\u00a0each mobile application Threat-Event\u00a0and Threat-Score can be consumed in\u00a0MAUI Apps\u00a0at the discretion of the mobile developer and used, in combination with other mobile application data, to adapt the business logic or user experience when one or more attacks or threats are present.\n\n### Using Conditional Enforcement for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nConditional Enforcement is an extension to Appdome\u2019s mobile application Threat-Event framework. By using conditional enforcement, developers can control when Appdome enforcement of each mobile application protection takes place or invoke backup, failsafe, and enforcement to any in-app enforcement used by the mobile developer.  \nFor more information on using conditional enforcement with your Threat-Event implementation, please contact\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com).\n\n### Verifying Threat-Events in MAUI Apps\n\nAfter you have implemented the required Threat-Event code in your\u00a0MAUI Apps, you can confirm that your Threat-Event implementation(s) is properly recognized by the Appdome protections in the\u00a0MAUI Apps. To do that, review the\u00a0Certified Secure\u2122\u00a0DevSecOps certificate for your build on Appdome.\n\nIn the Certified Secure DevSecOps certificate, a\u00a0correct\u00a0implementation of Threat-Events in your mobile application looks as seen below.\n\n![Ios Android Cert 2 1000px 2](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IOS-Android-cert_-2-1000px-2.png)\n\nWhen Threat-Events implementation appears to be missing in your mobile application, the following indication will be shown in the Certified Secure DevSecOps certificate:\n\n* **Android**:![Android Missing Threat Events Implementation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Android_Missing_Threat_Events_Implementation-650x130.png)\n* **iOS**:![Ios Missing Threat Events Implementation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ios_missing_threat_events_implementation-650x132.png)\n\nFor information on how to view and/or retrieve the Certified Secure DevSecOps certification for your mobile application on Appdome, please\u00a0visit the knowledge base article\u00a0[Using Certified Secure\u2122 Android & iOS Apps Build Certification in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/certified-secure-android-ios/using-certified-secure-android-ios-apps-build-certification-in-devops-cicd/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1693905206612.1693916106921.187&__hssc=79098507.1.1693916106921&__hsfp=3406240815)\n\n### Questions Using Threat-Events\u2122 in MAUI Apps?\n\nIf you have specific questions about implementing Threat-Events or Threat-Scores in\u00a0Kotlin Apps, fill out the inquiry form on the right-hand side of this knowledge base article or contact\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com).

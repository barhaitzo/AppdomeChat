It\u2019s typically used for espionage and data theft. AhMyth allows attackers to access files and apps on the device, capture photos and record audio using the camera and microphone, manage SMS messages and calls, and track the device\u2019s location. Additionally, AhMyth can capture keystrokes, enabling it to steal sensitive information. It is usually distributed through malicious apps or APKs, and often masquerades as legitimate apps to gain access to users\u2019 devices.\n\nFollowing are some of the exploit methods used by **AhMyth** as well as mobile functions it abuses:\n\n* Remote access to control the device.\n* Access to the camera and microphone for capturing photos and recording audio.\n* Management of SMS messages and calls.\n* Location tracking to determine the device\u2019s geographic position.\n* Keylogging to capture keystrokes and steal sensitive information.\n\n## How Does Appdome Protect Against AhMyth?\n\nTaking all the above into consideration, you can use Appdome to protect against **AhMyth** using a combination of following protection methods:\n\n* **[RASP](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/)** \u2013 Prevents AhMyth from injecting itself into installed apps and repackaging them.\n* [**Code Obfuscation**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-code-obfuscation/)\u00a0\u2013 Protects against decompiling and malicious reverse engineering.\n* [**Root Detection**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/jailbreak-root-detection/build-root-detection-protect-android-apps/)\u00a0\u2013 Protects app from running on rooted Android device.\n* **[Anti Remote Desktop Control](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/social-engineering-prevention/block-remote-desktop-exploits-in-android-apps/)** \u2013 detects malicious 3rd party apps that attempt to remotely control your protected mobile application.\n* [**Keylogging Prevention**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/ato-prevention/protect-android-ios-apps-from-keylogging-malware/) \u2013 Prevents the use of malicious keyloggers which may be used to intercept two-factor authentication codes or harvest sensitive information.\n* **[Google Play Store Signature Validation](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/social-engineering-prevention/use-google-play-signature-validation-to-prevent-fake-apps-mods/)**\u00a0\u2013 protects against fake apps, clones, masquerading.\n* **[Detect Fake Location](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/geo-compliance/detect-fake-location-in-android-apps/)** \u2013 Detect when an attacker modifies or interferes with the device level geolocation using hooking, tampering or other reverse engineering methods and tools that can be used to modify or spoof GPS data or signals.\n\nEach of the protections above are linked to the relevent knowledge base article for that feature, which provide detailed information about each feature and also explain how to implement each protection in your Android app.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s to protect Android apps against **AhMyth**, you\u2019ll need the following:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free

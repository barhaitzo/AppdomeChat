SDKProtect\u2122 is precisely engineered to secure mobile SDKs against a wide variety of threats. This article provides a step-by-step guide for SDK mobile developers and SDK vendors on how to use SDKProtect\u2122 to secure their iOS SDKs, focusing on the xcframework.zip format.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting the process of securing your SDK with Appdome, ensure you have the following:\n\n* An Appdome account ([create a free Appdome account here](https://www.appdome.com))\n* A license for SDKProtect\u2122\n* A valid iOS xcframework.zip\u00a0file\n* Add input threat event permissions to your xcframework. For more details, see: [How to use SDK Input Threat Events for iOS XCFrameworks](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/use-sdk-input-threat-events-for-ios-xcframeworks/)\n\n## Key Features of SDKProtect\n\n**SDK Threat Shielding**\u00a0encrypts, obfuscates, and safeguards SDK components, fortifying them against cyber threats for enhanced security.\n\n1. **Obfuscate SDK Logic** \u2013 Obfuscated SDK classes and methods from reverse engineering.\n2. **Obfuscate Objective-C** \u2013 Obfuscate Objective-C class and method names in the SDK binary.\n3. **Obfuscate Swift Metadata** \u2013 Scrambles class hierarchies, method details, and type structure in SDK Swift Metadata.\n4. **Strip Export Names** \u2013 Removes the index that associates symbol names with addresses.\n5. **Verify SDK Integrity** \u2013\u00a0Ensures that the SDK assets and libraries have not been tampered with or altered.\n6. **Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122** \u2013\u00a0Obfuscates the SDK logic to make it harder for attackers to reverse-engineer the SDK.\n7. **Encrypt SDK DBs** \u2013\u00a0Protects the data created by the SDK on the device by establishing a secure data container. This prevents the application from accessing the SDK\u2019s encrypted data.\n8. **Encrypt SDK Preferences**: Encrypts the SDK preferences/settings to prevent unauthorized access.\n9. **Prevent Logging Attack****\u2014**This feature\u00a0prevents log function calls in an iOS device, protecting\u00a0sensitive data from leaking to malicious actors.\n10. **Protect Info.plist \u2013** Encrypts specific keys within the Info.plist files.\n11. **SDK MitM Defense**: Protects the data created by the SDK on the device by establishing a secure data container. This prevents the application from accessing the SDK\u2019s encrypted data.\n12. **Secure Certificate Pinning**: Secure Certificate Pinning securely stores the certificate(s) of known trusted servers in the SDK and validates the authenticity of the certi\ufb01cate before the connection is established.\n\n### SDK Threat Intelligence\n\nThreat Intelligence combines the power of Threat-Shielding and Mobile Risk Evaluation with the following visibility and control options.\n\n* + **Threat-Monitoring** \u2013 Identifies and reports any risk anomalies found in the SDK and transmits the data to ThreatScope\u2122 for enhanced security oversight.\n  + **Threat-Streaming** \u2013\u00a0Provides regular updates on the SDK\u2019s health status during runtime and alerts to any possible threats to ensure operational safety.\n\n1. **Jailbreak Detection:** Detects users attempting to run your application on a jailbroken device.\n2. **Simulator Detection:** Detects if the SDK is running on a simulator.\n3. **Detect Debugging:** Identifies if the SDK is being debugged.\n4. **Detect App is Debuggable:** Detects when a debugger is attached to the SDK or the SDK is marked as Debuggable.\n5. **Detect Hooking Frameworks:** Identifies if any hooking frameworks are being used to manipulate the SDK.\n6. **Anti-Swizzling:** Detects and prevents malicious method swizzling.\n7. **Immutable Device ID:** Provides a unique, unchanging device ID to improve security and ensure consistent recognition.\n8. **Detect FaceID Bypass:** Detects when an attacker tries to bypass FaceID or facial recognition using Deepfake methods.\n\n## Workflow for Securing iOS SDKs with SDKProtect\n\n1. **Upload an SDK file**\n   * Drag and drop a `xcframework.zip` file or browse to upload the SDK.  \n     ![Upload An SDK](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Upload-an-SDK.png)\n2. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the SDK Threat-Shielding feature as shown below:  \n   ![Create Fusion Set Sdk Threat Shielding](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Create-Fusion-Set-SDK-Threat-Shielding.png)\n3. Building the SDK Threat-Shielding & SDK Threat Intelligence feature via Appdome Console  \n   To build the SDK Threat-Shielding & SDK Threat Intelligence protection using Appdome Console, follow the instructions below.\n   * How: Toggle (turn ON) **SDK Threat-Shielding**, as shown below\n   * How: Toggle (turn ON) **SDK MitM Defense**, as shown below\n   * How: Toggle (turn ON) **Threat Monitoring** and **Threat Streaming**, as shown below\n   * Select which features you want to turn on, such as Jailbreak Detection, Simulator Detection, Detect Debugging, Detect Hooking Frameworks, and Detect FaceID Bypass.\n   * Click on Build My SDK to initiate the build process.  \n     [![Ios Sdk Ui](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iOs_SDK_UI.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iOs_SDK_UI.png)\n4. **Sign** **On Appdome (Recommended)**\n   * **P12 File**: Mandatory for signing.\n   * **Password**: Mandatory for signing.\n   * Click Sign My SDK  \n     ![Sign SDK On Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sign-SDK-on-Appdome-2.png)\n5. **Private Signing**\n   * Select the option Private Signing from the drop-down menu.  \n     For more details on how to privately sign your SDK, see [How to Sign an xcframework.zip iOS SDK](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/sign-secured-ios-sdks/) on Appdome.\n6. **Download SDK**\n   * After building and signing, click on \u201cDownload\u201d to retrieve the signed SDK.  \n     ![Image 20240702 113800](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-20240702-113800-1077x731.png)\n\n## About Appdome Mobile SDK Threat-Events\n\nAppdome Threat-Events use industry-standard notification methods to pass events from the Appdome layer back to the SDK so that the SDK can take further action whenever Appdome detects malicious events against an Appdome-protected SDK.\n\nWhen Appdome detects a security event, the event can be handled in one of the following ways:\n\n**In-App Detection**\n\nAppdome detects the attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the SDK for processing (your SDK chooses how and when to enforce it).\n\n**In-App Defense**\n\nWhen a security violation such as debugging, hooking, or swizzling is detected within the Appdome-protected SDK during app runtime, Appdome sends the event data directly to the SDK. This enables Appdome to apply predefined security protocols, which might include terminating the app session to prevent further exposure.\n\n**Enforce Connection Only (for [SDK MitM Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/defend-against-mitm-man-in-the-middle-attacks-in-mobile-sdks/) only):**\n\nWhen Appdome detects a security event, it passes the event from the Appdome layer to the SDK and blocks the connection that triggered the event.\n\n**Block Debugging (for iOS only)**\n\nWhen the Block Debugging threat event is triggered, Appdome blocks the unauthorized debugging attempt and sends an event notification to the SDK interface.\n\n**Note:** If you wish to use Threat Events with the above SDK features, please make sure that your SDK includes the correct implementation.\n\n**Example**  \n![Missing Sdk Threat Event](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Missing-SDK-TE.png)\n\nFor more details on SDK Threat Events, see\u00a0[How to use SDK Input Threat Events for iOS XCFrameworks](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/use-sdk-input-threat-events-for-ios-xcframeworks/)\n\n### Certified Secure\n\nThis certificate verifies that Appdome has secured your SDK (com.iOS.sdk.id) with specific security features, as identified in the certification details. Issued to your secured SDK, this certificate details the implementation of Appdome\u2019s SDK Threat Shielding and SDK Threat Intelligence features that you have chosen to build into your SDK.\n\n![Appdome iOS Certificate ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/appdome.iosSDK2-Certificate-.png)\n\nAppdome offers a powerful, user-friendly platform for SDK vendors to enhance the security of their mobile SDKs.

This will allow developers to test and validate an Appdome-secured app on an iOS device.\n\nWe hope you find it useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Sideload Secured iOS Apps using iMazing\n\nWhen you are using iMazing to sideload apps follow the same process for an Appdome-secured app as for a unsecured app. Whether it\u2019s for testing or other business reasons, sometimes you need to utilize a process called \u201csideloading\u201d to install an application onto an iOS device directly from a computer. Here at Appdome we often sideload applications, even those build with third party SDKs, for testing purposes.\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\n## Prerequisites to Sideload Secured iOS Apps using iMazing\n\nIn order to sideload your iOS App, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [iMazing](https://imazing.com/download) app installed\n* Fuse your mobile .ipa binary application file\n* Sign the app\n\n## 5 Easy Steps to\u00a0Sideload Secured iOS Apps using iMazing\n\n1.

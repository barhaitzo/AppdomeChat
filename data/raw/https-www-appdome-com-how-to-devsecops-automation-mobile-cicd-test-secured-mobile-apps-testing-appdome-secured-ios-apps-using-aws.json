This integration enhances mobile app security effectively within your existing application lifecycle, leveraging the speed and agility of DevSecOps.\n\n### Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service (Recommended)\n\nWith an Appdome SRM license, you can use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service to quickly and easily test your Appdome-secured mobile apps on AWS without the need for different Fusion Sets.\u00a0 Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida.\n\nFor details, see\u00a0[How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## General Information About Testing in iOS Apps\n\nBelow are the Appdome security features that may be triggered during testing on AWS, along with their behaviors under the Build2Test setting:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Secure App Signature | AWS might resign the app after installation. | The app will detect this but will not crash, allowing testing to continue. |\n| Detect App is Debuggable | AWS may sign the app as debuggable upon installation | The app will detect if the app is debuggable and will continue running without crashing. |\n| Prevent Code Injection | AWS devices might detect and block unauthorized code injections to safeguard the app\u2019s integrity. | The app will receive an alert when a potential code injection is detected but will not crash, allowing testing to continue. |\n| Cipher Suites | AWS supports a variety of cipher suites, which Appdome can restrict to enforce secure communications as per app-specific protocols. | The app will acknowledge the cipher suites but will continue operating normally during testing. |\n\n## How to Upload and Test Your App on AWS\n\n1. Log into your AWS account.  \n   ![Log Into Aws Account](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Log-into-AWS-Account.png)\n2.

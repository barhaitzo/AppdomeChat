Whether you\u2019re a testing vendor integrating into CI/CD workflows, a mobile development team debugging Android apps, or a QA engineer evaluating profiling exposure before adding security, Build2Test offers a purpose-built path tailored to your use case.\n\nYou can test protected apps in environments that typically trigger security alerts\u2014such as automation frameworks, debugging sessions, and profiling tools\u2014without compromising the app\u2019s security posture or requiring changes in the app code. Below, we break down the three core paths available within the Build2Test service.\n\n**Build2Test for Vendors**\n\nAutomated testing is essential for modern DevOps and QA teams working across a wide range of devices and OS versions. However, common automation tools like Magisk or Frida\u2014frequently used in these environments\u2014can trigger false alarms in mobile app security systems, causing apps to crash or terminate unexpectedly.\n\nAppdome\u2019s Build2Test is purpose-built to address this challenge. It automatically detects trusted testing environments\u2014including platforms like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, BitBar, and LambdaTest\u2014and safely disables security alerts that would otherwise interrupt test runs. This ensures smooth, uninterrupted testing of Appdome-secured apps and accelerates secure app delivery in CI/CD workflows.\n\n**Built2Test for App Debugging**\n\nDebugging tools are commonly used during development to inspect app behavior, troubleshoot issues, and improve performance. However, these tools can also pose serious security risks in production. Attackers may use them to bypass authentication, alter app logic, extract sensitive information, or interfere with security controls.\n\nAppdome\u2019s Build2Test service helps you identify potential security exposures by testing how your Android app behaves in environments where debugging activity may be present. For example, Appdome checks whether your app is configured as debuggable\u2014a condition that makes it easier for attackers to analyze or manipulate your app at runtime.\n\n**Built2Test for App Profiling**\n\nApp profiling is a common technique used during development and testing to monitor app performance, behavior, and system interactions. However, profiling tools can also be exploited to analyze, reverse-engineer, or manipulate an app in unintended ways.\n\nAppdome\u2019s Build2Test service allows you to evaluate how your app behaves in environments where profiling activity is present, identifying potential security gaps or behaviors that may put your app at risk when exposed to inspection or monitoring tools. For example, Appdome detects if Android Developer Options are enabled\u2014an indicator that the device may be set up for deeper system access, which can increase the risk of profiling or reverse engineering.\n\nAppdome\u2019s Build2Test service can be used in either of the following ways:\n\n* Via [Appdome DEV-API](https://apis.appdome.com/docs).\n* Via Appdome\u2019s Console (see the instructions below)\n\n## Use Build2Test Service via the Appdome Console\n\n### Before You Begin\n\n* Any events encountered when testing the selected service will not raise alarms and notifications. With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of the selected testing service and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida.\n* Ensure you have the following:\n  + [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=79098507.cb249e6cb815c754ee1ea4633650c79f.1683458843950.1683458843950.1683547752843.2&__hssc=79098507.1.1683547752843&__hsfp=3783124442).\n  + An Appdome version supporting the Build2Test service.

However, the very features that make SDKs valuable also introduce significant security concerns due to their inherent complexity and broad accessibility.\n\nSDKs typically encompass a vast array of functionalities packaged into an extensive codebase. This complexity can introduce multiple layers of potential vulnerabilities, as the deep and often intricate code structures provide numerous attack surfaces for malicious entities. Complex systems may contain security flaws that are harder to detect and can be exploited by attackers to perform actions like data breaches or unauthorized access.\n\nSDKs are designed to be integrated into multiple apps, making them highly accessible and reusable across different development projects. While this promotes efficiency and functionality, it also means that SDKs are more exposed to misuse. Publicly available or widely used SDKs can be specifically targeted by attackers because a single vulnerability can potentially impact multiple applications at once.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you start, ensure you have the following:\n\n* An\u00a0**Appdome account**\u00a0([Create a free account here](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=27234274.a6717a67918c9f46522403bb29f1660f.1733646284445.1739367711713.1739437853260.146&__hssc=27234274.9.1739437853260&__hsfp=3280552524))\n* A\u00a0**license for SDKProtect\u2122**\n* A valid\u00a0**.aar file or iOS framework**\u00a0(Check that your SDK is in one of these formats)\n\n## What is Appdome SDKProtect?\n\nAppdome SDKProtect is a new service on Appdome that enables mobile SDK developers to quickly and easily create protected and threat-aware versions of their mobile SDKs, reducing fraud and ensuring compliance. SDKProtect is specifically engineered to secure mobile SDKs against a wide variety of threats.\n\n## Key Features of SDKProtect\n\n**SDK Threat Shielding**\u00a0encrypts, obfuscates, and safeguards SDK components, fortifying them against cyber threats for enhanced security.\n\n* 1. **Obfuscate SDK Logic**\u00a0\u2013 Obfuscate SDK classes and methods to protect against malicious reverse engineering.  \n     \\* Excludes Specific Classes \u2013 List class or package prefixes to exclude from obfuscation.\n  2. **Dex File Encryption** \u2013 Encrypts static and embedded dex files in the SDK.\n  3. **Encrypt SDK Strings**\u00a0\u2013 Encrypts all SDK Java application strings.\n  4. **Verify SDK Assets and Libs** \u2013 Verify the authenticity of SDK native libraries and assets.\n  5. **Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122**\u00a0\u2013 Obfuscate sources, libraries and strings of Appdome code.\n  6. **Encrypt SDK DBs**\u00a0\u2013 Protects data created by the SDK on the device by establishing a secure data container that also ensures that the application cannot access the SDK\u2019s encrypted data.\n  7. **Encrypt SDK Preferences** \u2013 Protects SDK shared preferences so they cannot be modified by malicious actors attempting to change the way the SDK behaves.\n  8. **SDK MitM Defense** \u2013 Validates the authenticity of communication sessions initiated by the SDK. This is achieved by pinning the server-side certificate and performing chain validation.\n\n### SDK Threat Intelligence\n\nThreat Intelligence combines the power of Threat-Shielding and Mobile Risk Evaluation with the following visibility and control options.\n\n* **Threat-Monitoring** \u2013 combines the SDK protections with real-time attack monitoring and enterprise-grade intelligence via Appdome ThreatScope\u2122 Mobile XTM.\n* **Threat-Streaming**\u00a0\u2013 provides real-time telemetry data that can be streamed to the SDK back-end to create specific outcomes or responses when attacks happen.\n  1. **Root Detection** \u2013 Identify users attempting to run your mobile application on a rooted device.\n  2. **Emulator Detection** \u2013 Identify users attempting to run your mobile application on a rooted device.\n  3. **Detect Debugging** \u2013 Detect when a debugger is attached to the SDK or the SDK is marked as Debuggable\n  4. **Detect Frida** \u2013 Automatically detect and block Frida-based toolkits from reverse-engineering and instrumenting your application\u2019s UI and logical flow.\n  5. **Detect Inline Hooks** \u2013 Detect when a debugger is attached to the SDK or the SDK is marked as Debuggable.\n  6. **Immutable Device ID** \u2013 Appdome provides a unique, unchanging device ID to improve security and ensure consistent recognition.\n  7. **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)** \u2013 Automatically detects and prevents the use of Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for malicious reverse engineering, debugging, remote shell, etc.\n\nBy implementing these security measures, Appdome\u2019s SDKProtect not only shields mobile SDKs from exploitation but also enhances the overall trustworthiness of the mobile applications that utilize the SDK.\n\n**Note:** If you wish to use Threat Events with the above SDK features, please make sure that your app includes the correct implementation.\n\n**Example**  \n![Missing Sdk Threat Event](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Missing-SDK-TE.png)\n\nFor more details on SDK Threat Events, see [How to Implement Threat Event Handling in Android SDKs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/implementing-threat-event-handling-in-android-sdks/).\n\n## Workflow for Securing iOS SDKs with SDKProtect\n\n1. **Upload an SDK file**\n   * Drag and drop an .aar file or browse to upload the SDK  \n     [![Upload An Sdk](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Upload-an-SDK.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Upload-an-SDK.png)\n2. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the SDK Threat-Shielding feature as shown below:  \n   [![Sdk Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SDK-Fusion-Set.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SDK-Fusion-Set.png)\n3. Building the SDK Threat-Shielding & SDK Threat Intelligence feature via Appdome Console\n   * + Select which features you want to turn on, such as Root Detection, Emulator Detection, Detect Debugging and Detect Inline hooks.\n     + Click on Build My SDK to initiate the build process.\n\n   [![Android Sdk Ui](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Android_SDK_UI.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Android_SDK_UI.png)\n4. Download the built SDK file. Click the button, two files will be downloaded to your computer:\n   * The SDK .aar file.\n   * The Certified Secure certificate  \n     [![Download Sdk](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Download-SDK.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Download-SDK.png)\n\n### Certified Secure Certificate\n\nThis certificate verifies that Appdome has secured your SDK with specific security features, as identified in the certification details.

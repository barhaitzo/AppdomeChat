Unlike system identifiers like IDFA, GAID, and IDFV\u2014which are user-resettable and easily spoofed\u2014IDAnchor generates a stable identity using immutable signals across the device, app install, and app release lifecycle. This identity remains consistent even across reinstalls, resets, and app updates, helping stop fraud techniques such as account takeovers, promo abuse, synthetic device creation, and credential reuse. Because modern fraud often involves legitimate logins from compromised or unknown devices, IDAnchor enables developers to detect anomalies even when no active threat is present. The similarity scoring engine provides a confidence level indicating how closely the current session matches the known device profile. This defense supports compliance efforts such as PSD2 and FFIEC by enabling contextual risk checks without using PII.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Android Apps With IDAnchor\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic **IDAnchor** plugin for Android and iOS apps creates a persistent, cryptographically bound Mobile Device ID using secure signals from the device, OS, and app. The plugin also generates unique install and release fingerprints that survive resets, while preventing spoofing, ID rotation, and device cycling. Developers can retrieve IDAnchor values on demand or during threat events, compare values in-app or on-server, and use similarity scoring to assess identity confidence. Appdome\u2019s Threat-Events\u2122 provides real-time alerts and controls when ID anomalies or spoofing attempts are detected.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Appdome's IDAnchor Plugins:\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s mobile app security build system to  **Use IDAnchor** , you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **IDAnchor**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see [**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n## How to Implement Use IDAnchor in Android Apps Using Appdome\n\nOn Appdome, follow these **3 simple steps** to create self-defending Android Apps that **Use IDAnchor** without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1. ### [**Designate**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) the Mobile App to be protected.\n\n   1. #### Upload an app via the Appdome Mobile Defense platform GUI or via Appdome\u2019s DEV-API or CI/CD Plugins.\n   2. **Android Formats:** .apk or .aab\n   3. **IDAnchor is compatible with:**\n      Java, JS, C++, C#, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, Cordova and other Android apps.\n2. ### Select the defense: **IDAnchor**.****\n\n   1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the IDAnchor feature as shown below:\n\n      ![fusion set that contains IDAnchor](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/android_fs_image.png)\n\n      Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the IDAnchor feature\n\n      1. Follow the steps in Sections [2.2-2.2.2](#2.2) of this article to add the IDAnchor feature to your Fusion Set via the Appdome Console.\n      2. When you select the **IDAnchor** you'll notice that the Fusion Set you created in step [2.1](#2.1) now bears the icon of the protection category that contains IDAnchor.\n\n         ![Fusion Set applied IDAnchor](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/idanchor_android_fs.png)\n\n         Figure 2: Fusion Set that displays the newly added IDAnchor protection\n           \n         Note: Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n      3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c...\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set. Copy\n         the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):\n         ![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/copy_fs_id.png)\n\n         Figure 3: Fusion Set Detail Summary\n      4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI or other system:\n         1. Refer to the [Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link) for API building instructions.\n         2. Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python).\n   2. #### Add the **IDAnchor** feature to your security template.\n\n      1. Navigate to **Build**  > **IDAnchor** tab > **Android IDAnchor** section in the Appdome Console.\n\n         Like all other options in ONEShield\u2122, IDAnchor is turned on by default, as shown below:\n         ![IDAnchor option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Android_IDAnchor_IDanchor_Toggle-2.png)\n\n         Figure 4: Selecting IDAnchor   \n         Note: The App Compromise Notification contains an easy to follow default remediation path for the mobile app end user. You can customize this message as required to achieve brand specific support, workflow or other messaging.\n\n      - Toggle On  > **IDAnchor**.\n          \n\n        (a) Choose to monitor this attack vector by checking the Threat Events\n        checkbox associated with **IDAnchor** as shown below.\n\n          \n\n        (b) To receive mobile Threat Monitoring, check the ThreatScope\u2122 box as shown below.\n        For more details, see our knowledge base article on [ThreatScope\u2122 Mobile XTM](/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-xtm/).\n\n        ![IDAnchor option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Android_IDAnchor_IDanchor_Toggle-2.png)\n\n        Figure 4: Selecting Use IDAnchor\n\n      2. Select the Threat-Event\u2122 in-app mobile **Threat Defense and Intelligence** policy for **IDAnchor**:  \n         1. **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > In-App Detection**\n\n            When this setting is used, Appdome detects attempts to spoof, cycle, or reset the device identity and passes Appdome\u2019s Threat-Event\u2122 attack intelligence to the app\u2019s business logic for processing, enforcement, and user notification.\n            For more information on consuming and using Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 in the app, see section Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Use IDAnchor Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps.\n   3. Initiate the build command either by clicking **Build My App** at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in Figure 4)\n      or via your CI/CD as described in Section [2.1.4](#2.1.4).\n\n   **Congratulations!** The IDAnchor protection is now added to the mobile app\n3. ### **Certify the IDAnchor feature in Android Apps**\n\n   After building IDAnchor, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the IDAnchor protection has been added and is protecting the app. To verify that the IDAnchor protection has been added to the mobile app, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:\n   ![IDAnchor shown in Certificate secure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Android_Certified_Secure_Certification_For_IDAnchor-7.png)\n\n   Figure 5: Certified Secure\u2122 certificate\n\n   Each Certified Secure\u2122 certificate provides DevOps and DevSecOps organizations the entire workflow summary, audit trail of each build, and proof of protection that IDAnchor has been added to each Android app. Certified Secure provides instant and in-line DevSecOps compliance certification that IDAnchor and other mobile app security features are in each build of the mobile app.\n\n## Using Threat-Events\u2122 for IDAnchor Intelligence and Control in Android Apps\n\nAppdome Threat-Events\u2122 provides consumable in-app mobile app attack intelligence and defense control when **IDAnchor** is detected. To consume and use Threat-Events\u2122 for\nIDAnchor in Android Apps, use registerReceiver in the Application OnCreate, and the code samples for Threat-Events\u2122 for IDAnchor shown below.\n\nThe specifications and options for Threat-Events\u2122 for IDAnchor are:\n\nThreat-Event\u2122 Elements | Use IDAnchor Method Detail || Appdome Feature Name | IDAnchor |\n| Threat-Event Mode | |\n| OFF, IN-APP DEFENSE | Appdome detects, defends and notifies user (standard OS dialog) using customizable messaging. |\n| ON, IN-APP DETECTION | Appdome detects the attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (app chooses how and when to enforce). |\n| ON, IN-APP DEFENSE | Uses Appdome Enforce mode for any attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (gather intel on attacks and threats without losing any protection). |\n| Certified Secure\u2122 Threat Event Check |  |\n| Visible in ThreatScope\u2122 |  |\n| Developer Parameters for Using IDAnchor Threat-Event\u2122 | |\n| Threat-Event **NAME** | IDAnchor |\n| Threat-Event **DATA** | reasonData |\n| Threat-Event **CODE** | reasonCode |\n| Threat-Event **SCORE** | || currentThreatEventScore | Current Threat-Event score |\n| threatEventsScore | Total Threat-events score |\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| carrierPlmn | PLMN of the device. Only available for Android devices. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| deviceBrand | Brand of the device |\n| deviceBoard | Board of the device |\n| buildUser | Build user |\n| buildHost | Build host |\n| sdkVersion | Sdk version |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n\n  \n\nWith Threat-Events\u2122 enabled (turned ON), Android developers can get detailed attack intelligence and granular defense control in Android applications and create amazing user experiences for all mobile end users when IDAnchor is detected.\n\n  \n\nThe following is a code sample for native Android apps, which uses all values in the specification above for IDAnchor:\n\n  \n\n**Important!** Replace all placeholder instances of <Context Key> with the specific name of your threat event context key across all language examples. This is crucial to ensure your code functions correctly with the intended event data.\nFor example, The <Context Key> could be the message, externalID, OS Version, reason code, etc.\n\n

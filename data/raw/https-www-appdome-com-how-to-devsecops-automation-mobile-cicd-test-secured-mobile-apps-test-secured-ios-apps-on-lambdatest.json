With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida. For more details, see [How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## General Information about Testing in iOS Apps\n\nLambdaTest allows testing apps using its App Live and App Automate features, which can both be used to test Appdome-secured mobile apps.\n\nWhen using LambdaTest\u00a0to run Real Device App Automation testing on an Appdome-protected app, you can choose between either of the following methods:\n\nThe following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered, the reason why, and how to avoid it during the app building stage on Appdome:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Prevent App Screen Sharing | LambdaTest allows a live view of the device screen while the test is running. | The app will recognize the screen recording but will continue running without crashing. |\n| Detect App is Debuggable | LambdaTest signs the app as debuggable upon installation. | The app will acknowledge the debuggable state but will continue operating normally during the testing process. |\n| Anti Remote Desktop Control | LambdaTest might use remote control tools during tests to trigger this protection. | The app will detect remote control attempts but will not terminate the session, allowing testing to proceed. |\n| Secure App Signature | LambdaTest might resign the app upon installation to match its test environment, triggering the app signature protection. | The app will detect the signature change but will not crash, allowing the testing to continue without interruption. |\n\n## Real Device (Live) App testing \u2013 iOS\n\n**To initiate****Real Device (Live) App****test of your test app in LambdaTest**:\n\n1. [**Log in to your LambdaTest****account**](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login). Alternatively, if you do not yet have an account, [**Create an account**](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).\n2. On the menu on the right bar, click\u00a0**Real Device > App Testing**.  \n   You will now see a list of previously uploaded iOS and Android apps.  \n   ![Previously displayed apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PreviosulyDisplayedApps.png)\n3. Select **iOS** platform on the left side of the screen.\n4. Select your app to test from the apps list.\n\n   If you have not previously uploaded your app, you can do it now by clicking on **UPLOAD** to upload the app directly from your computer, or **URL** to obtain the app from somewhere else.\n5. Select a test device of your choice by selecting its brand, device name and OS version from the list on the right.\n6. Click\u00a0**Start**\u00a0to start testing.  \n   ![Start testing iOS](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/StartTesting-iOS-535x366.png)  \n   The app will be automatically installed on the selected device and then launched. The app\u2019s device control buttons are displayed on the left.\n7. Click the app on the screen to use it.\n8. When done, click\u00a0**End Session** (red button on the left side of the screen).\n\n## Real Device App\u00a0Automation\u00a0Testing on iOS\n\nLambdaTest has several Appium capabilities, namely: a series of key-value pairs that allow you to configure your tests on LambdaTest. For further details, see the [Capabilities Builder \u2013 Appium](https://www.browserstack.com/app-automate/capabilities) webpage.\n\nThe network Log Appium capability can trigger Appdome protection features, as specified below.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **LambdaTest-Specific Appium Capability** | **Reason** |\n| networkLog | LambdaTest signs the app as debuggable upon installation. |\n| networkLog | LambdaTest uses a MitM proxy |\n\n**Note**:\n\nFor additional measures to take during app build on Appdome, see section\u00a0**General Information about Testing in iOS Apps** above.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n* Most automation test tools can typically be used in one of two modes:\u00a0**emulator mode**and\u00a0**real device****mode**(specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cemulator mode\u201d instead of \u201creal device mode\u201d, the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device. This is expected because Appdome\u00a0[ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) protects apps from running on emulators/simulators. Instead, you should run the automation test tool in real device\n\n## Demo: Build2Test Integration for LambdaTest\n\n#### \n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on LambdaTest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-android-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [How to Test Appdome-secured iOS Apps on Browserstack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-appdome-secured-ios-apps-by-using-browserstack/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on Browserstack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-on-browserstack/)\n* [How to Test Appdome-Secured Android Apps on SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/appsec-release-orchestration-testing-protected-mobile-apps-test-appdome-secured-android-apps-by-using-saucelabs/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-saucelabs-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

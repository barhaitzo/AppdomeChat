Jailbreaking removes Apple\u2019s built-in security restrictions, giving attackers unrestricted, elevated access to the device\u2019s filesystem and full control over installed apps. Once jailbroken, attackers can bypass app security controls, connect over SSH to establish shell access, inject malicious tweaks into memory, manipulate transactions or steal credentials, and much more. Malicious jailbreak detection bypass tools like HideJB, FlyJB, and Liberty Lite are designed to conceal the jailbreak status from mobile apps. One common attack involves using the \u201cSSL Kill Switch\u201d tweak to disable SSL pinning and intercept encrypted traffic. The increasing use of AI-based malware to jailbreak devices and auto-conceal their state makes detection even more difficult. Defending against jailbreak detection bypass is critical for protecting authentication, session control, data integrity, and for meeting requirements under PCI DSS, GDPR, and other security compliance frameworks.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Mobile Apps Against Jailbreak Detection Bypass\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic **Detect** **Jailbreak Detection Bypass**\u00a0plugin for iOS identifies and blocks utilities and methods used to hide jailbreak status, such as HideJB, Liberty Lite, FlyJB, and KernBypass. The plugin continuously monitors for filesystem anomalies, unauthorized tweaks in memory, and runtime behaviors associated with jailbreak concealment. Developers can use Appdome\u2019s Threat-Events\u2122 to gather real-time data on detected jailbreak bypass events and build customized responses to each threat.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Appdome's Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass Plugins:\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s mobile app security build system to  **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass** , you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS)\n* Signing Credentials (see [**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n## How to Implement Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass in iOS Apps Using Appdome\n\nOn Appdome, follow these **3 simple steps** to create self-defending iOS Apps that **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass** without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1. ### [**Designate**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) the Mobile App to be protected.\n\n   1. #### Upload an app via the Appdome Mobile Defense platform GUI or via Appdome\u2019s DEV-API or CI/CD Plugins.\n   2. **iOS Formats:** .ipa\n   3. **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass is compatible with:**\n      Obj-C, Java, Swift, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, Cordova and other iOS apps.\n2. ### Select the defense: **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass**.****\n\n   1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass feature as shown below:\n\n      ![fusion set that contains Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/ios_fs_image.png)\n\n      Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass feature\n\n      1. Follow the steps in Sections [2.2-2.2.2](#2.2) of this article to add the Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass feature to your Fusion Set via the Appdome Console.\n      2. When you select the **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass** you'll notice that the Fusion Set you created in step [2.1](#2.1) now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass.\n\n         ![Fusion Set applied Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Saved_FS_Detect_Jailbreak_Detection_Bypass-.png)\n\n         Figure 2: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass protection\n           \n         Note: Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n      3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c...\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set. Copy\n         the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):\n         ![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/copy_fs_id.png)\n\n         Figure 3: Fusion Set Detail Summary\n      4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI or other system:\n         1. Refer to the [Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link) for API building instructions.\n         2. Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python).\n   2. #### Add the **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass** feature to your security template.\n\n      1. Navigate to **Build**  > **Anti Malware** tab > **iOS Hacking Tool** section in the Appdome Console.\n\n         Like all other options in ONEShield\u2122, Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass is turned on by default, as shown below:\n         ![Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Detect_Jailbreak_Detection_Bypass_Toggle.png)\n\n         Figure 4: Selecting Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass   \n         Note: The App Compromise Notification contains an easy to follow default remediation path for the mobile app end user. You can customize this message as required to achieve brand specific support, workflow or other messaging.\n\n      - Toggle On  > **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass**.\n          \n\n        (a) Choose to monitor this attack vector by checking the Threat Events\n        checkbox associated with **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass** as shown below.\n\n          \n\n        (b) To receive mobile Threat Monitoring, check the ThreatScope\u2122 box as shown below.\n        For more details, see our knowledge base article on [ThreatScope\u2122 Mobile XTM](/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-xtm/).\n\n        ![Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Detect_Jailbreak_Detection_Bypass_Toggle.png)\n\n        Figure 4: Selecting Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass\n\n        Note:  The Appdome Platform displays the Mobile Operation Systems supported by each defense in real-time.\n        For more details, see our [OS Support Policy KB](/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-os-compatibility/appdome-support-and-eol-policies-for-mobile-oss-and-sdks/).\n\n      2. Select the Threat-Event\u2122 in-app mobile **Threat Defense and Intelligence** policy for **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass**:  \n         1. **Threat-Events\u2122 OFF > In-App Defense** \n\n            If the Threat-Events\u2122 setting is not selected.\n            Appdome will detect and defend user and app by enforcing Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass.\n         2. **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > In-App Detection**\n\n            When this setting is used, Appdome detects tools which try to hide that your device is jailbroken and passes Appdome\u2019s Threat-Event\u2122 attack intelligence to the app\u2019s business logic for processing, enforcement, and user notification.\n            For more information on consuming and using Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 in the app, see section Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps.\n         3. **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > In-App Defense**\n\n            When this setting is used, Appdome detects and defends against Jailbreak Detection Bypass (same as Appdome Enforce) and passes Appdome\u2019s Threat-Event\u2122 attack intelligence to the app\u2019s business logic for processing.\n            For more information on consuming and using Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 in the app, see section Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps.\n      3. Configure the User Experience Options for **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass**:\n           \n         With Threat-Events\u2122 OFF, Appdome provides several user experience options for mobile brands and developers.\n         1. App Compromise Notification: Customize the pop-up or toast Appdome uses to notify the user when a threat is present while using the protected mobile app.\n         2. Short message Option. This is available for mobile devices that allow a banner notification for security events.\n         3. Localized Message Option. Allows Appdome users to support global languages in security notifications.\n\n            ![Localized Message](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/localized_message.png)\n\n            Figure 5: Default User Experience Options for Appdome\u2019s **Jailbreak Detection Bypass**\n         4. **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass** Threat Code\u2122. Appdome uses AI to generate a unique code each time\n            **Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass** is triggered by an active threat on the mobile device.\n            Use the code in Appdome Threat Resolution Center\u2122 to help end users identify, find and resolve active threats on the personal mobile devices.\n   3. Initiate the build command either by clicking **Build My App** at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in Figure 4)\n      or via your CI/CD as described in Section [2.1.4](#2.1.4).\n\n   **Congratulations!** The Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass protection is now added to the mobile app\n3. ### **Certify the Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass feature in iOS Apps**\n\n   After building Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass protection has been added and is protecting the app. To verify that the Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass protection has been added to the mobile app, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:\n   ![Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass shown in Certificate secure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ios_Certified_Secure_Certificate_For_Detect_Jailbreak_Detection_Bypass.png)\n\n   Figure 6: Certified Secure\u2122 certificate\n\n   Each Certified Secure\u2122 certificate provides DevOps and DevSecOps organizations the entire workflow summary, audit trail of each build, and proof of protection that Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass has been added to each iOS app. Certified Secure provides instant and in-line DevSecOps compliance certification that Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass and other mobile app security features are in each build of the mobile app.\n\n## Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Jailbreak Detection Bypass Intelligence and Control in iOS Apps\n\nAppdome Threat-Events\u2122 provides consumable in-app mobile app attack intelligence and defense control when **Jailbreak Detection Bypass** is detected. To consume and use Threat-Events\u2122 for\nJailbreak Detection Bypass in iOS Apps, use AddObserverForName in Notification Center, and the code samples for Threat-Events\u2122 for Jailbreak Detection Bypass shown below.\n\nThe specifications and options for Threat-Events\u2122 for Jailbreak Detection Bypass are:\n\nThreat-Event\u2122 Elements | Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass Method Detail || Appdome Feature Name | Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass |\n| Threat-Event Mode | |\n| OFF, IN-APP DEFENSE | Appdome detects, defends and notifies user (standard OS dialog) using customizable messaging. |\n| ON, IN-APP DETECTION | Appdome detects the attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (app chooses how and when to enforce). |\n| ON, IN-APP DEFENSE | Uses Appdome Enforce mode for any attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (gather intel on attacks and threats without losing any protection). |\n| Certified Secure\u2122 Threat Event Check |  |\n| Visible in ThreatScope\u2122 |  |\n| Developer Parameters for Detecting Jailbreak Detection Bypass Threat-Event\u2122 | |\n| Threat-Event **NAME** | JailbreakBypassDetected |\n| Threat-Event **DATA** | reasonData |\n| Threat-Event **CODE** | reasonCode |\n| Threat-Event **REF** | 6924 |\n| Threat-Event **SCORE** | || currentThreatEventScore | Current Threat-Event score |\n| threatEventsScore | Total Threat-events score |\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n| reason | Detection cause |\n| data | Detection cause data |\n\n  \n\nWith Threat-Events\u2122 enabled (turned ON), iOS developers can get detailed attack intelligence and granular defense control in iOS applications and create amazing user experiences for all mobile end users when Jailbreak Detection Bypass is detected.\n\n  \n\nThe following is a code sample for native iOS apps, which uses all values in the specification above for Detect Jailbreak Detection Bypass:\n\n  \n\n**Important!** Replace all placeholder instances of <Context Key> with the specific name of your threat event context key across all language examples. This is crucial to ensure your code functions correctly with the intended event data.\nFor example, The <Context Key> could be the message, externalID, OS Version, reason code, etc.\n\n

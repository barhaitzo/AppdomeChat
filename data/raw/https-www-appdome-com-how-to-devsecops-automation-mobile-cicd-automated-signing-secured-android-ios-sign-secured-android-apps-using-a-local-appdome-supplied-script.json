You can download and run this script locally, supplying your keystore file, passwords, and key alias to produce a fully signed Android app.\n\nAuto-DEV Private Signing is designed for automation and integrates easily into CI/CD pipelines. Build systems such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Bitrise can incorporate Auto-DEV signing to enable secure, consistent, and repeatable Android app delivery.\n\n### Trusted Signing Certificates\n\nAuto-DEV Private Signing uses Appdome\u2019s **Trusted Signing** model to validate signing integrity based on authorized certificate fingerprints, rather than distribution-specific signing behavior. Customers explicitly define which signing certificates are trusted, and any app signed with one of these certificates is considered valid and will not trigger anti-tampering protections.\n\nThis unified model replaces previous toggle-based signing behavior and enables consistent signing across production, testing, and enterprise distribution workflows.\n\n## Before You Begin\n\nEnsure the following prerequisites are met:\n\n* You have an **Appdome IDEAL or higher** account with **Appdome-DEV access**\n* Your app is built with Appdome\u2019s features and is ready to be signed\n* Your **Android SDK Build Tools** version is **35.0.0 or later**\n\n  This version includes required updates to `apksigner` (16KB alignment and ZIP alignment metadata)\n* The **Java version** in your local environment is equal to or newer than the version used to generate your keystore\n\n  To verify, run: `java -version`\n* You have access to your **Android signing keystore**\n* At least one **SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint** is available (required for Auto-DEV Private Signing)\n\n### Environment Requirements\n\n**macOS / Linux**\n\n* Python 3.6 or later\n* `keytool` (JDK 1.8 or later)\n* `zipalign` (Android SDK Build Tools 35.0.0 or later)\n* `apksigner` (Android SDK Build Tools)\n\n**Windows**\n\n* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\n* A Linux distribution supporting OpenJDK 8 (for example, Ubuntu)\n* Python 3.6 or later\n\n## 1. Generate a Certificate Fingerprint\n\nThe fingerprint is a one-way hash of the certificate stored in the Android signing Keystore.\n\nLocal signing may fail if the certificate fingerprint you provide doesn\u2019t match the keystore, due to Appdome\u2019s Anti-Tampering protections.  \nTo get the fingerprint, follow these steps:\n\n##### Step by Step:\n\n1. On your workstation, run:\n\n   ```\n   keytool -list -v -keystore <path_to_keystore> -storepass <store pass> -alias <alias>\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, use this command:\n\n   ```\n   keytool -printcert -jarfile <apk/aab_file>\n   ```\n\n   The SHA1 or the SHA256 of the signature will be marked inside the output.\u00a0 This is a public identifier that can also be extracted from the signed .apk. The output should look like this:\n\n   ```\n   test-alias, Nov 20, 2017, PrivateKeyEntry, \r\n   Certificate fingerprint (SHA1):BE:D2:E3:17:9F:20:9A:F9:CF:55:E8:31:21:8C:7E:C7:7F:87:62:26\n   ```\n2. Copy the fingerprint.\n\n## 2. Seal The App in Appdome\n\n#### Step by step:\n\n1. Generate the\u00a0**SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint**\u00a0from your signing keystore.\n2. Select the\u00a0**APK or AAB**\u00a0you want to sign (the app must complete the Build process).\n3. In the upper navigation bar, select\u00a0**Sign**.\n4. Next to\u00a0**How Would You Like to Sign?**, select\u00a0**Auto-DEV Private Signing**.\n5. Under\u00a0**Trusted Signing Certificates**, click + to add a SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint\n6. (Optional) Add an Annotation to document certificate usage.\n7. (Optional) Select the Trusted Store Signing checkbox\n8. Select Auto-DEV Sign Privately.\n9. In the pop-up message, select\u00a0**Continue with Private Signing**.\n10. (Optional) Select the checkbox to save your signing credentials.\n11. Once sealing is complete, download the app and the generated signing script.  \n      \n    [![Android Auto Dev Private Sign Appdome1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Auto_Dev_Private_Sign_Appdome1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Auto_Dev_Private_Sign_Appdome1.png)\n\n    \u2026\n\n## 3. Configure Your Environment\n\n### For Mac OS or Linux:\n\n##### Step by Step:\n\n1. Locate your zipalign and apksigner executables on your computer.\n2. Add their full location (SDK Built tools) to your environment $PATH variable, for example:\n\n```\nexport PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/29.0.0\n```\n\n### For Windows-Subsystem-Linux\n\n##### Step by Step:\n\nAfter you have installed the Linux distribution on your Windows computer, open the WSL console and run the following commands:\n\n```\nsudo apt update sudo dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt update\r\nsudo dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt install -y unzip zipalign lib32z1 openjdk-8-jdk gradle\r\ncurl https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip --output/tmp/sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip\r\nunzip/tmp/sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip -d ~/Android\r\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64\r\ncd Android/tools/bin\r\n./sdkmanager \"platform-tools\" \"platforms;android-29\" \"build-tools;29.0.0\"\r\nexport ANDROID_HOME=~/Android\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/29.0.0\r\ncd ~\r\nandroid update sdk --no-ui\r\ngradle -v\r\nadb start-server\n```\n\n## 4. Run the Auto-DEV Private Script\n\nIn some environments, you may be required to grant executable permissions to the signing script (using [chmod +x command](https://ss64.com/bash/chmod.html)).\n\n##### Step by Step:\n\nTo run the automatic private signing script, use the following command:\n\n```\nsign.sh --output <path_to_outputfile.apk or path_to_outputfile.aab> --keystore <path_to_keystore> --keystore_pass <keystore password> --key_pass <key password> --keystore_alias <key alias>\n```\n\n**Congratulations!** You now have a signed app with Appdome\u2019s Auto-DEV private signing script.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Using a local Appdome supplied script](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-ios-apps-using-a-local-appdome-supplied-script/)\n* [How to Sign Secured Android Apps Using apksigner](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-android-apps-using-apksigner/)\n* [How to Code Sign Secured iOS Apps in DevSecOps Build System](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/code-sign-secured-ios-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n* [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Using codesign](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-ios-apps-using-codesign/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [**support.appdome.com**](http://support.appdome.com/ \"http://support.appdome.com/\") or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

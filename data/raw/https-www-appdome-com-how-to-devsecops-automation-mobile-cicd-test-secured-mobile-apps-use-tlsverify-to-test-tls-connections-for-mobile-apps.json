To simplify the troubleshooting process, Appdome has created TLSVerify, a dedicated debugging apps for iOS and Android to assist you in testing the TLS connections of your mobile apps. This knowledge base articles describes how to use TLSVerify to test TLS connections for mobile apps.\n\n## Prerequisites to Use TLSVerify to Test TLS Connections for Mobile Apps\n\n* The debugging app (iOS or Android, available upon request from the\u00a0[Appdome support team](mailto:support@appdome.com)).\n* Mobile device (iOS or Android) with access to the tested servers.\n* The servers URLs which your app connects to.\n\n## How to Use Use TLSVerify to Test TLS Connections for Mobile Apps\n\nAfter you received the TLSVerify from the support team, you\u2019ll need to install in on your device.\n\nYou will receive an installation link:\n\n![Screenshot 2023 01 22 At 16.38.37](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2023-01-22-at-16.38.37-207x366.png)\n\nYou can access this link in your mobile device\u2019s browser and install the app directly on your phone (you might need to allow installation of apps from \u201cunknown sources\u201d).\n\nAlternatively, you can access the link with a PC, and download the binary to sideload the app. For Android devices, you can [sideload it from the Command Line Through ADB](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/troubleshooting-secured-apps/sideload-secured-android-app-using-adb/) (Android debug bridge), or services like\u00a0[AirDroid](https://www.airdroid.com/)\u00a0to install the app. For iOS devices, you can [sideload the debug app using MacOS.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/troubleshooting-secured-apps/sideload-secured-ios-app-using-imazing/)\n\nOnce you have the app ready, follow these steps:\n\n## 5 Easy Steps to Use TLSVerify to Test TLS Connections for Mobile Apps\n\n1. Launch the TLSVerify app\n2. Enter the server URL that your app is connecting during its run time.\n3. Click on the **UIWebView** browser\n4. The requested browser will be opened and you will be redirected to the entered server URL.  \n   ![Troubleshoot TLS issues](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Presentation1.png)  \n   The TLSVerify App will inspect the connection for anything that looks suspicious. Once the app detects an unprotected connection. Many problems can be found when troubleshooting TLS issues. Some key examples are expired certificate, non-secure or disallowed cipher suite, old TLS version) it will alert the problem with a pop-up custom notification.  \n   For example, here is a notification about an expired certificate:  \n   ![Troubleshoot TLS issues - expired certificate](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Presentation3.png)\n\n5.\u00a0 To close the browser and return to the debug app main screen, click\u00a0**Close**.  \n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Presentation4-1.png)\n\n## Using the Android Debug App to troubleshoot TLS issues\n\n1. Launch the app\n2. Enter the server URL that your app is connecting during its run time.\n3. Click **GO**.You will be redirected to the entered server URL.![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Presentation4.png)  \n   The Secured Network Communication Debugging App will inspect the connection for anything that looks suspicious. Once the app detects an unprotected connection (for example, expired certificate, not allowed cipher suite, etc) it will alert the problem with a pop-up custom notification.  \n   For example, here is a notification about an expired certificate:\n\n   ###\n4. To refresh the connection, click on **GO** again\n\n## Common Network Error Notifications When Testing TLS Connections\n\n| **Notification** | **Troubleshooting** |\n| --- | --- |\n| The certificate has expired | Check the expiration date of the certificates in your SSL certificates chain. |\n| The issuer certificate of a locally looked up certificate could not be found.  This normally means the list of trusted certificates is not complete. | Verify that the identity of the Intermediate\u00a0Certificate Authority (CA) certificate isn\u2019t missing and recognized on the device. |\n| The certificate was not found in the list of trusted certificates. | Add the relevant certificate to your SSL certificates chain. |\n| The TLS version is not 1.2 | Verify the app is using TLS 1.2 version for network communication. Appdome can assist the user to\u00a0[Enforce TLS Versions.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/enforce-minimum-tls-version-android-ios-apps/) |\n| The Hostname didn\u2019t match the hostname in the certificate | Verify the hostname in the certificate is the same host that your app tries to access. |\n| Leaf certificate shouldn\u2019t be CA | Change the leaf certificate in your SSL certificates chain. |\n| Non-leaf certificate should be CA | Verify all the certificated in the certificates chain are valid.  Appdome can assist the user to\u00a0[Enforce Certificates Roles.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/enforce-ssl-tls-certificate-roles-android-ios-apps/) |\n| Only specific cipher suites are allowed | Verify the cipher suite the connection is using was defined in the allowed cipher suites.  Appdome can assist the user to\u00a0[Enforce TLS Cipher-Suites.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/enforce-ssl-tls-cipher-suites-android-ios-apps/) |\n| The certificate doesn\u2019t have basic constraints | The error occurs because\u00a0basicConstraints\u00a0extension in one of the basic CA certificates\u00a0is not set to\u00a0TRUE.  One of the basic CA certificates is not enabled to sign other public keys to generate client certificates. |\n\nYou are welcome to contact Appdome\u2019s\u00a0[support team](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0with any questions.\n\n## Didn\u2019t get any notification?\n\nGreat!

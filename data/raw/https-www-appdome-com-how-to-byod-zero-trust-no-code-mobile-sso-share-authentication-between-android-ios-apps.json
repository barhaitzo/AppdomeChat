They were written by different developers and have no way of using one app\u2019s authentication state in the other apps on the same mobile device. This Knowledge Base article explains how to share authentication between Android and iOS apps using Appdome\u2019s Cross-App ID. Cross-App ID can be added to any iOS or Android app instantly, with no code or coding.\n\n## How to Share Authentication Between Android and iOS Apps\n\nCross-App ID is the ability of two or more **mobile apps to share authentication state**. Known as cross-app identity, this allows end-users of mobile apps to sign into one app, simultaneously unlocking (i.e., authenticating) the other apps used by that user.\n\nIn order for mobile apps to share authentication state, Appdome\u2019s Cross-App ID uses metadata to verify user login between apps. Appdome-Built apps using Cross-App ID share such metadata securely. This allows the user to login once, sharing and updating the metadata needed for other built apps automatically. Appdome provides a framework in its Fusion Layer that allows other mobile apps to access the metadata, such as cookies, auth-state for apps built with Open-ID for SSO, Keychain in iOS apps, and Credentials in iOS apps. The data is saved outside the app\u2019s sandbox. For security, the data is encrypted with a unique key that is shared only with other built apps in the group. The selected apps with access to the metadata are defined by a dynamic trust group, consisting of Appdome-Built Cross-App ID apps created in\u00a0the same Account, Team, or Fusion Set on Appdome.\n\nThe following diagram further elaborates on the Cross-App ID capability and flow:\n\n1. The \u2018first\u2019 app is challenged with the authentication by the identity provider protecting the resource (\u2018App Server\u2019 in the diagram). It performs the authentication and receives the token/cookies once authentication is successful.\n2. The authenticated app stores the authentication credentials within Appdome\u2019s Secure Storage.\n3. When the second built app is launched, it searches the Appdome Secure Storage, and since relevant authentication credentials for that specific identity provider/gateway exist in the\u00a0Secure Storage, it extracts the cookies/token.\n4. When the second built app tries to reach the protected resource (App server), it attaches the authentication header/cookie to the outgoing request. Since the gateway/identity provider trusts these credentials, the App can reach the protected resource without triggering authentication within the second app.\n\n![Cross-App ID enables Mobile Apps to Share Authentication State](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-31-10.32.05-1200x784.png)\n\n## 5 Easy Steps to Share Authentication Between Android and iOS Apps\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add Cross-App ID to Any Mobile App and enable these mobile apps to share authentication state:\n\n1. Configure your desired SSO provider as described in\u00a0[Appdome for Single Sign-on](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-mobile-sso/use-enterprise-authentication-mobile-apps/)\n2. Open the Scheme drop-down list named\u00a0**Appdome SSO+ Suite**\n3. In the Appdome SSO+ Suite, enable Cross-App ID\n4. In Shared Scope, select the sharing option which best suits your deployment\n5. When finished, click\u00a0**Build My App.**\n\nNotes:\n\n* Only built apps can share data, none built apps won\u2019t have access to the encrypted data\n* Only built apps in the same \u201cShared Scope\u201d will share data\n* Cookies will be saved per URL. Make sure that the login URL is the same in all desired apps\n* To share state among OpenID Connect apps, you must Build all apps with the same client id\n  + Sign all iOS apps with the same provisioning profile to allow access to a directory outside of the app\u2019s sandbox\n\n![Cross-App ID enables Mobile Apps to Share Authentication State](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cross-app-id-2-170x51.png)\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to add conditional access to the mobile app in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0You now have a mobile app fully integrated with Cross-App ID.\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\n\u2026\n\n## After Adding Cross-App ID\u00a0to a Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAfter you have added Cross-App ID to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built App\n\nAppdome is a full featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read the knowledge base article\u00a0[How to Update App Icon Branding in Secure Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps).\n\n### Sign the Appdome-Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-Built app, it must be signed.\u00a0[Signing iOS app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode )\u00a0and\u00a0[Signing an Android app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/)\u00a0are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use\u00a0[Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the\u00a0Appdome-Built App\u00a0to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Built apps, please read the knowledge base article\u00a0[How to Auto Publish Secured Android & iOS Apps to app stores](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\n### **How Do I Learn More?**\n\nCheck out Appdome for SSO+\u00a0[blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/appdome-for-sso-a-better-way-to-add-sso-to-mobile-apps/)\u00a0or\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions around enabling mobile apps to share authentication state, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

App PROTECT also protects your app against malware and cheat engines that rely on Jailbreak and Root to launch attacks against your app. Whether your goal is to pass a pen test, security audit or simply stop hackers from exploiting your app and its data, Appdome App PROTECT is the right choice for you.\n\n## Appdome App Protect, Protects the App and the App\u2019s Data\n\nApp PROTECT provides the industry\u2019s only no-code mobile app security solution capable of protecting any Android and iOS mobile app and its data from exploit and compromise. It is perfect for blocking static and dynamic analysis tools, passing pen tests, stopping hackers who attempt to access or harvest local data-at-rest, and blocking tools and methods that rely on OS compromise (Jailbreak and Root).\n\nApp PROTECT includes the following top features from Appdome:\n\n[ONEShield\u2122 App Hardening](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) \u2013 Comprehensive, self-defending, no-code mobile app shielding and hardening solution that prevents dynamic analysis, tampering, modifying, debugging or interfering with the app\u2019s workflows as well as blocks emulators and simulators. ONEShield includes these defenses throughout the app, including hundreds of overlapping Checksum validations to ensure tamper resistance of the app.\n\n[TOTALCode\u2122 Obfuscation](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/no-code-mobile-app-obfuscation-resources/) \u2013 Complete no-code, advanced code obfuscating solution that prevents static analysis, obfuscates the entire binary, protects native code as well as non-native code/libraries, SDKs and frameworks in the app. Specific add-ons include relocating control flows, scrambling your app\u2019s logic, and stripping debug information \u2013 all without symbolization or decorating your code or limiting how your app functions.\n\n[TOTALData\u2122 Encryption](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/prevent-mobile-data-exploits-data-at-rest-encryption/) \u2013 AES-256 or FIPS 140-2 Data-at-Rest Encryption for all data stored by the mobile app, in the app sandbox, SD Card and file system, as well as encryption for app preferences, app secrets, XML and other strings, resources and DEX files (Java classes).\n\n[OS Security Integrity](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-jailbreak-root-prevention/protect-ios-apps-jailbreak-jailbreaking-tools/) \u2013 Prevents the app from running on rooted and jailbroken environments, root hiding, root and jailbreak tools, and hacking and cheat engines that rely on root and jailbreak.\n\n## Additional Services\n\nAdditional features are available with the [App DEFEND](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/appdome-app-defend-package/) Package.\n\n24x7x365 customer support as well as advanced services such as Appdome-GO, Appdome-DEV, Appdome-DEV Support, Appdome-DEV Tools and Appdome-DEV API are available at an extra charge.\n\n## Learn More\n\nTo learn more, please visit the [Appdome pricing page](/appdome-pricing/) or [contact sales](https://www.appdome.com/contact-appdome/mobile-app-security/).\n\nWant a Demo?\n\nAppdome Basics\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Appdome_Team_Photos_Gil_Hartman_BW.jpg)\n\nGilWe're here to help\n\n\n\n\nWe'll get back to you in 24 hours to schedule your demo.\n\n* [Home Page](https://www.appdome.com/)\n* [Dev+Sec Blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/)\n* [Request A Demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/appdome-home/)\n* [Platform](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-tool-cicd/)\n* [Pricing](https://www.appdome.com/appdome-pricing/)\n* [About](https://www.appdome.com/about/)\n* [Patents](https://www.appdome.com/legal/patents/)\n* [Knowledge Base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/)\n* [In The News](https://www.appdome.com/in-the-news/)\n* [Careers we\u2019re hiring!](https://www.appdome.com/about/work-at-appdome/)\n* [Terms Of Use](https://www.appdome.com/legal/terms-of-use/)\n* [Press Releases](https://www.appdome.com/press-releases/)\n* [Privacy Policy](https://www.appdome.com/legal/privacy-policy/)\n* [Contact Us](https://www.appdome.com/contact-us/)\n\n\n\n---\n\nREDWOOD CITY OFFICE\n\n* 3 Twin Dolphin Drive,   \n  Suite 375 Redwood City,   \n  CA 94065\n* Phone: [+1.650.567.6100](tel:+16505676100)   \n  Mobile: [+1.844.360.FUSE (3873)](tel:+1844360FUSE (3873))   \n  Email: [info@appdome.com](mailto:info@appdome.com)\n\nISRAEL OFFICE\n\n* 21 HaArba'a Street,\n* Phone: [+97235568332](tel:+97235568332)   \n  Email: [info@appdome.com](mailto:info@appdome.com)\n\nSearch for:\n\nFollow us\n\n\u00a92026 Appdome, Inc.

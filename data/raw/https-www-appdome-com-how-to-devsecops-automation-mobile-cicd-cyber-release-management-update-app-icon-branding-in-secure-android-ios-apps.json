Brand enterprise approved secured Mobile Apps without coding.\n\n## How to Update App Icon Branding in Secure Android & iOS Apps\n\nAdding customized mobile app branding and configuring the app to run in a specific environment is a major feature in app development. When deploying third-party applications, this option is mostly unavailable or costly to achieve.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article summarizes the steps required to customize mobile app branding and add network configuration to mobile apps using the ContextTMstep in the Appdome workflow.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## Appdome Context Enables App Customization, Configuration, and Branding for Secured Apps\n\nContextTM is an Appdome service allowing a user to customize apps with a custom icon, app name, and private URL.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement. Likewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on the original apps icon, language or App layout inside the app. The Appdome technology implements Context adaptations, adds frameworks, and more to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nThe App customization divides into three sub-categories:\n\n* **App Display Customization** \u2013\u00a0customize the app\u2019s icon, display name or add a favicon\n* **App Configuration**\u2013 [add a custom configuration.](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-config-files-urls-plist-enterprise-apps/)\n* **App Set-Up** \u2013 add multi-language support, and scaling support.\n\nUsing Appdome, users can change the app\u2019s icon and name, as if it was natively coded to the app. Appdome\u2019s Context is compatible with mobile apps built in any development environment including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps, and non-native apps built-in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic and more. This streamlines implementations, cuts development work, and ensures a guaranteed and consistent customization of any mobile app.\n\n## How to Customize Your App Using Appdome Context\u2122\n\nOnce you have successfully secured an app on Appdome, follow these step-by-step instructions to customize the secured mobile app:\n\n**Navigate to Context\u2122 in the Appdome Workflow**\n\nSelect the\u00a0**Build Tab**. Beneath the Build Tab, select **ContextTM**.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n\nAlternatively, you may be redirected to this step after every [App Fusion](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/using-no-code-security-android-ios-apps/). *Note: Context is not mandatory. If you don\u2019t wish to add any of the Context features you may press Skip.*\n\n**Add App Display Customization**\n\n1. **Enter a new display name**\u00a0(optional).\n2. **Upload a new App icon**, if you don\u2019t upload an icon, the original icon will be used.\n3. **Toggle \u201cON\u201d Add Favicon** (optional)\n4. **Upload a Favicon** image (Favicon file should be a PNG format file whose size should not exceed 1MB)\n5. From the drop-down, select the Favicon location.\n6. Using the slide bar adjusts the Favicon size.\n\n![App.display.customization](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/app.display.customization-1.png)\n\n**Add App Configuration**\n\nEdit App-specific configuration \u2013 for more information please read the Knowledge Base article\u00a0[How to Update Config Files, URLs & plists in Enterprise Apps.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-config-files-urls-plist-enterprise-apps/)\n\n**App Set-Up**\n\nUniversal App Scaling \u2013 only supported for iOS apps. allow apps to be installed and displayed correctly on all device sizes (iPads for example).\n\nUnified App Localization \u2013 supports resources such as language added to your app during fusion to work natively with the fused app.\n\n### After Setting Up the Context for Your App\n\n1. You can **Skip** the process and you will be redirected to [App Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) without any Context features added.\n2. Click\u00a0**Add Context to My App** to add your selected features. And will redirect you to [App Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/).\n\n![Appcontext](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/appcontext.png)\n\nThe technology behind Add Context to My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to customize your mobile app in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0You now have a mobile app integrated with Appdome\u2019s Context.\n\n![Adding Context to Mobile App | Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/completed-adding-context_.png)\n\n### How to Sign and Publish Secured iOS and Android Apps\n\n**Sign the Appdome-secured App**\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-secured app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS apps](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/) and [Signing Android apps](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) is easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n**Deploying/Publishing Secured iOS and Android Apps**\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-secured app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice.

This is achieved by ensuring\u00a0that roles, responsibilities, and entitlements are distributed among various teams. Additionally, it prevents any team member involved in sharing Fusion Sets between different teams from being a member of both teams.\n\nSeparation of Duties, also known as segregation of duties, comprises operational practices and internal compliance measures aimed at preventing security control failures and/or abusive practices. This goal is achieved by distributing the responsibilities and associated privileges for a specific security process across multiple individuals on different teams. Controls and entitlements are applied to enforce this separation and prevent any team member from assuming roles in multiple teams. A practical example of separation of duties would be a scenario where a person who **requests** approval for a task is not allowed to **approve** it themselves.\n\n## Prerequisites for using Appdome Release Fusion Set\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s **Release Fusion Set** feature, you\u2019ll need the following:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* A [Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/build-security-template-android-ios-apps/) which you want to release\n* A license to **Release Fusion Set**\n* The [entitlement](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/set-user-entitlements-mobile-app-security-projects/) of **Release Fusion Set** must be enabled for a particular Appdome user.\n\n## How To Use Appdome Release Fusion Set (With Separation of Duties)\n\nTo access the **Release Fusion Set** feature, use any of the methods below:\n\n* Create a fusion set\n* Select the **Release Fusion Set** icon (which becomes visible when hovering).  \n  ![Saved Fusion Set Data At Rest Encryption](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Saved-Fusion-Set-Data-at-Rest-Encryption.png)\n* Alternatively, click the \u2026 (**Details**) icon to open Fusion Set Summary, with the **Fusion Set details** tab displayed by default.\n* Click **Release Fusion Set**.  \n  **![Release Fusion Set Data At Rest Encryption ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Release-Fusion-Set-Data-at-Rest-Encryption_.png)**\n* After selecting Release Fusion Set, you may be presented with several options. If your company requires separation of duties, select the option Release Fusion Set to New Team, as shown below. This option will ensure that the Released Fusion Set is frozen for both teams and maintain separation of duties by not allowing team members to be part of both the originating team and the receiving team for the Released Fusion Set.  \n  ![Release Fusion Set To Team](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Release-Fusion-set-to-Team-1.png)\n* To continue with the **Release Fusion Set To New Team** option**,** enter the **Team Name** and **Team ID** in the required fields, as shown below.  \n  **Note:** In order to use the **Release Fusion Set To New Team** option, we recommend including Fusion Freeze Settings for both teams, even if the Fusion Set for the originating team was not frozen. For more details on how to freeze fusion sets, please refer to this knowledge base article:\u00a0[How to Freeze-Lock Protection Templates for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/freeze-lock-moible-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-rcs-in-devsecops-build-system/).\n\n  **Note:** Before clicking **Release**, you can cancel or click the X button at the top right to avoid this option. Then, go back to Team Selection, and select a different fusion set to copy to the new team. For more details on Fusion Set templates, please refer to this knowledge base article:\u00a0 [How to Create and Manage Appdome Mobile App Protection Templates for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/create-mobile-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/).\n* Click **Release**![Enter Team Details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Enter-Team-Details.png)\n* Upon successful release, the team member who released the Fusion Set will see the following notification.  \n  ![Released Fusion set](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2024-05-08-at-11.41.20-e1715157762547.png)\n* After releasing the Fusion Set, you will see an indication within your own Team (Team 1) that the Fusion Set is frozen and released, as shown in the figures below.![Release Fusion Set Confirmation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Release-Fusion-Set-Confirmation.png)\n\n  ![Released Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Released-Fusion-Set.png)\n\nThe **receiving** Team (Team 2)\u00a0 will see an on-screen alert notifying them that the Fusion Set has been released to their team. Entitled members of the receiving team will see an option to either \u201c**Accept**\u201d or \u201c**Decline**\u201d the Released Fusion Set (**Note**, only team members who have the proper entitlement will see this alert).\n\n![Accept:decline Fusion Set Import](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AcceptDecline-Fusion-Set-IMport.png)\n\n**Note:** The receiving team will also receive an email notification (if that option is enabled) with all the details about the released fusion set.\n\nThe receiving team can **preview** all the security features contained within the Released Fusion Set by selecting it.\n\n**Note:** The receiving team will not be able to build with the Released Fusion Set until they have accepted it. This is indicated when the Build My App button remains disabled (greyed out) until the Released Fusion Set is accepted.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [Freeze Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/freeze-fusion-set-security-templates/)\n* [How to Manage Fusion Set Security Templates iOS/Android](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/manage-fusion-set-security-templates-iosandroid/)\n* [How to Create and Manage Appdome Mobile App Protection Templates for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/create-mobile-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

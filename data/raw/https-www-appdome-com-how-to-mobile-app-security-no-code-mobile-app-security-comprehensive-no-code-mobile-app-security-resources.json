Appdome\u2019s Mobile App Security Suite includes six categories of security and mobile app protections, covering every major mobile security category.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides a comprehensive overview of Appdome\u2019s Mobile App Security Suite.\n\n## Mobile App Security Made Easy\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement mobile app security. Appdome\u2019s Mobile App Security Suite can be added to any iOS or Android app in seconds, with no code or coding.\n\nOn Appdome, users merely upload and Android (.apk or .aab) or iOS (.ipa) app, select the new features, SDKs or APIs needed in the apps, and click \u201cBuild My App.\u201d There is no development or coding dependencies, no wrappers and no limitation on the development environment used to build the app. Appdome\u2019s technology adds the new features to the mobile app as if the new features were natively coded to the app. Appdome is compatible with all Android and iOS mobile apps, including apps built natively and in non-native development environments like React Native, Cordova, and Maui, Xamarin.\n\nGenerally speaking, using Appdome requires public data only. For example, Appdome users upload mobile app binaries only (not source code) and implement mobile service vendor SDKs and APIs (all of which are publicly available). Even so, Appdome uses several safeguards to ensure that mobile apps are not malicious, user and project data are safe and access is controlled. Our goal is to protect our users and protect the use of Appdome to facilitate the broad adoption of our service.\n\n## The Complete List of Appdome Mobile App Security Suite\n\nBelow is a comprehensive listing of all categories, features, and options available in the Appdome Mobile App Security Suite.\n\n#### ONEShield\u2122 App Shielding/Hardening (RASP)\n\n* [Anti-Debugging](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/block-debugging-tools-hacking-android-ios-apps/) \u2013 Protects the app against malicious debugging.\n* [Block iOS Debuggers](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/build-anti-debugging-in-android-ios-apps/) \u2013 Enable Appdome\u2019s anti-debugging methods to protect the app from debugging attempts.\n* **Detect Debugger Code Manipulations** \u2013 Actively detects dynamic injection code manipulations performed by debuggers at run-time.\n* [Detect App is Debuggable](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/build-anti-debugging-in-android-ios-apps/)\u2013 Detect if the app has been re-signed with a certificate with debug entitlements.\n* [Anti-Tampering](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/prevent-mods-code-changes-mobile-apps/) \u2013 Protects the app from unauthorized changes.\n* [Obfuscate Security Features](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/use-appdomes-oneshield-obfuscate-security-features/) \u2013 Obfuscate sources and strings of Appdome-build code.\n* [Checksum Validation](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/use-checksum-validation-prevent-changes-mobile-apps/) \u2013 Performs a checksum validation on the app to verify app integrity (to ensure the app has not been modified since it was published).\n* [App Integrity/Structure Scan](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/verify-structure-integrity-android-ios-apps/)\u00a0 \u2013 Performs a structure scan of the app to validate proper app structure and integrity\n* [Prevent Code Tampering](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/prevent-code-tampering-in-android-ios-apps/) \u2013 Detect permanent application main executable code changes.\n* [Obj-C SelRef Protection](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-code-obfuscation/ios-selref-obfuscation-anti-reversing-in-ios-apps/) \u2013 Perform checksum validation on the application\u2019s main executable selref section.\n* [Anti Reversing](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/block-static-analysis-android-ios-app-features/) \u2013 Encrypts key logical elements and resources within your application such as methods, strings, and assets.\n* [Prevent Running on Simulators/Emulators](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/block-simulators-hacking-android-ios-apps/) \u2013 Protects the app by restricting execution to physical mobile devices only.\u00a0 Mobile simulators and emulators are software applications used on a computer as a virtual machine of a mobile device. They are often used to create virtual environments for hackers to scale their attacks, obtain/elevate root permissions, and perform reverse engineering, and hack mobile games.![Oneshield\u2122](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ONEShield\u2122.png)\n\n#### TOTALCode\u2122Obfuscation:\n\n* [Binary Code Obfuscation](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/obfuscate-mobile-apps-prevent-reverse-engineering/) \u2013 Obfuscates native code and libraries at the binary level.\n* [Flow Relocation](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/obfuscate-android-ios-control-flows-methods/) \u2013 Obfuscates control flows and business logic across the app binary to prevent dynamic and static analysis, tracing the source code etc.\n* [Non-Native Code Obfuscation](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/obfuscate-non-native-android-ios-code-frameworks/) \u2013 Obfuscates non-native code and libraries including JavaScript and/or DLL files for React Native, Cordova, Maui, Xamarin apps.\n* [Strip Debug Information](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/remove-debug-information-prevent-reverse-engineering/) \u2013 This feature removes source code file names, line numbers, and variable names, symbols.![Total Code Obfuscation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2022-12-01-at-14.31.34.png)\n\n#### TOTALDataTM\u00a0Encryption\n\n* [Data at Rest Encryption](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/prevent-mobile-data-exploits-data-at-rest-encryption/)\u00a0\u2013 Protects the data the application creates on the device.\u00a0 It will also create a secure data container that will prevent other applications from accessing the app\u2019s encrypted data and prevent the same application on a different device to open this encrypted data as well.\n  + [Encrypt and decrypt media files](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/play-encrypted-files-android-mediaplayer/)\u2013 With this option enabled, Android MediaPlayer can access encrypted media files, regardless of how the application accesses its files.\n  + [Exclude Media Files](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/excluding-files-file-types-media-from-android-ios-encryption/) -With this option enabled, media files can be shared to leverage external media apps and browsers\n  + [Exclude Web Files](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/excluding-files-file-types-media-from-android-ios-encryption/) \u2013 With this option enabled, local web file caching is enabled and will not be encrypted for web-intense apps.\n* [Encrypt In-App Preferences](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/encrypt-shared-preferences-android-apps/) \u2013 Encrypt all configuration files under/shared-prefs in Android and specific keys under NSUserDefaults in iOS.\n* [Encrypt Stings and Resources](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/encrypt-main-executable-strings-resources-ios-apps/) \u2013\u00a0Encrypts all CFStrings in iOS apps and all Java strings and the assets folder in Android.\n* [Secure Offline Access to encrypted data](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/enable-secure-access-offline-data-using-encryption/) \u2013 With this option enabled, Apps developers that require authentication can enable non-authenticated access to some of the files that the app generates.\n* In addition, Appdome offers encryption controls for different app needs:\n  + [Smart Offline Handoff](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/enable-secure-access-offline-data-using-encryption/)\u00a0\u2013 With this option enabled, Appdome will decrypt the app\u2019s data only after authentication with a remote server. Additionally, the developer can specify a folder for offline file access, and specify restriction for offline access to that folder.\n  + [Enable Restore From Backup](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/enabling-restore-from-backup/) \u2013 With this option enabled, the encryption key will be independent of device data, so migrating or restoring the device will not affect access to encrypted data.\n  + [In-App Generated Seed](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/use-external-seed-android-ios-encryption-key/) \u2013 With this option enabled, the app will seed the TotalData-Encryption-Key via event. Until the key is seeded, no files will be encrypted.\n* [FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Modules](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/encrypt-android-ios-data-fips-140-2/) \u2013 Uses FIPS140-2 certified cryptographic modules to handle all data in transit\n* [Encrypt Java Classes (.DEX files)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/encrypt-java-class-dex-android-apps-protect-data/) \u2013 Obfuscates and encrypts compiled Java code (ie: Java Classes, aka .DEX files). Only decrypts it during the run time while the app is used, then encrypts it again after use.\u00a0 APPCode Packer is compatible with mobile apps built with any development environment including Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, native Android apps, React Native, Ionic, and more app environments.![Toral data encryption](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2022-12-01-at-14.33.52.png)\n\n#### OS Integrity\n\n* [Root or Jailbreak Prevention](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-jailbreak-root-prevention/protect-ios-apps-jailbreak-jailbreaking-tools/)\u00a0 \u2013 prevents users from running apps on devices that have been jailbroken (iOS) or rooted (Android).\n* [Detect SELinux Enforcement](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-jailbreak-root-prevention/protect-ios-apps-jailbreak-jailbreaking-tools/) \u2013 Prevents users from running your Appdome built app on devices with no SELinux enforcement.\n* [Detect Unknown Sources](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-jailbreak-root-prevention/protect-android-apps-unknown-sources-enabled/) \u2013 Prevents users from running your built app when they\u2019ve enabled \u201callow app install from unknown sources\u201d native OS setting is enabled on the device.\n* [Detect Developer Options](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/jailbreak-root-detection/detect-android-developer-options-protect-android-apps/) \u2013 Prevents apps with \u201cdeveloper options\u201d OS setting on their devices they will not be able to run your app.\n* [Detect Banned Devices](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/jailbreak-root-detection/detect-banned-devices-in-android-apps/) \u2013\u00a0detects if the app is running on untrusted or banned devices.\n* [Appdome-Threat Events](https://appdome.com/how-to/application-threat-intelligence/mobile-threat-events/use-appdome-mobile-app-threat-intelligence/) \u2013 Lets developers change the default enforcement action upon detected threats. Appdome can pass enriched events or event metadata back to the app so that the app\u2019s own internal event structure, or a 3rd party threat response tool can handle the enforcement action after Appdome detects a threat. When In-App Event handling is enabled (ie: the toggle switch is ON), the event is handled by a mechanism within your app. When In-App Event Handling is OFF, the Appdome Security engine handles the event (usually resulting in the app Exiting after displaying a notification to the end-user).![OS integrity](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2022-12-01-at-14.35.39.png)\n\n#### Secure Communication\n\n* + [MitM Prevention](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/trusted-session-inspection/)\u00a0 \u2013 Performs automatic session validation on all attempted connections with the mobile app. Actively validates the session state machine, TLS certificates.\n  + [Malicious Proxy Detection](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/detect-block-malicious-proxies-android-ios-apps/) \u2013 detects and prevents MItM attacks on the application by preventing connections to unknown, untrusted, malicious proxies, or other intermediary devices.\n  + [Prohibit Stale Sessions](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/trusted-session-inspection/) \u2013 detects and prohibits reused sessions and reclaimed SessionIDs.\n  + [Trusted Root Certificates](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/trusted-session-inspection/) \u2013 In-app list of worldwide trusted CAs, independent from any CAs manually added to the device (you can add CAs to this list with Trusted CA Pinning).\n  + [FIPS 140-2 Encryption Modules](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/encrypt-android-ios-data-fips-140-2/) \u2013 implement FIPS 140-2 Compliant Cryptographic Modules in the communication.\n  + Appdome also offers additional controls to manages the mobile app\u2019s communication sessions:\n    -

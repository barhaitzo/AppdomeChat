This will allow developers to test and validate an Appdome-secured app on an Android device.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Sideload Secured Android Apps using ADB \u2013 .apk and .aab formats\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nADB stands for Android Debug Bridge.\u00a0\u00a0It is a tool you can use that allows you to connect an Android device over a USB cable to your computer.\u00a0 With this connection you can uninstall apps, issue shell commands to your device, install apps, and do more with your device.\u00a0 For more information on this [view this](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat) and\u00a0[look at this resource](https://www.howtogeek.com/125769/how-to-install-and-use-abd-the-android-debug-bridge-utility/).\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Sideload Secured Android Apps using Android Debug Bridge (ADB)\n\nFollow these instructions to sideload Secured Android Apps using Android Debug Bridge (adb)\n\n1. [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). Make sure [platform-tools](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html) has included adb the package.\n2. [USB driver](http://developer.sonymobile.com/wportal/devworld/search-downloads/driver) for the phone\n3. Build and Sign your mobile .apk or .aab binary application file\n\nTo facilitate the usage of **adb**, you need to allow USB debugging on your device:\n\n1. [Enable Developer Options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) on the Android Device:\n   1. Navigate to **Settings** > **About Phone.**\n   2. Scroll to the bottom.\n   3. Tap **Build number** seven (7) times.  \n      You\u2019ll get a short pop-up in the lower area of your display saying that you are now a developer.\n2. Go back and now access the *Developer options* menu, select the check box\u00a0*USB debugging*\u00a0and click **OK** on the prompt![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/usb2-768x273.png)\n3. When the device is connected to the computer, you should be prompted to \u201c**Allow USB debugging**.\u201d\u00a0 If so, check the box to *Always allow from this computer.*\n4. Click ******OK******![Sideload Android Apps - USB debugging ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/allow.png)\n\n## How to \u201cSideload\u201d an Appdome-built Android App from Command Line\n\nVerify your device is detected by enumerating the device tree using \u201c**adb devices -l\u201d**\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/68860620170124-4-z6u6ek)![Sideload appdome-built Android Apps from Command Line using ADB ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/68860620170124-4-z6u6ek)\n\nOn your computer use adb to install the app.\u00a0 Ensure you use the fully qualified path to the app if you are not running adb from the directory where the app is stored.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/68860720170124-4-1lxipxh)![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/68860720170124-4-1lxipxh)\n\n## **How to Sideload .aab Files & How to Install .aab Files**\n\nSideloading [Android App Bundle files](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) (.aab files) requires the [Bundletool](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/bundletool) utility. The sideloading takes two steps :\n\n1. Generate a set of apks from your original app bundle.\n\nbundletool build-apks \u2013bundle=***my\\_app.aab*** \u2013output=***my\\_app.apks***\n\n\u2013ks=**<*keystore.jks>***\n\n\u2013ks-pass=pass:**<keystore password>**\n\n\u2013ks-key-alias=***<key Alias>***\n\n\u2013key-pass=pass:***<key password>***\n\nThere are options like generating a universal apk (**\u2013mode=universal)** or generating a device-specific apk (**\u2013connected-device**).\n\n2.\u00a0 Deploy APKs to the connected device\n\nbundletool install-apks \u2013apks=**my\\_app.apks**\n\n**Congratulations!** The app is now installed on your Android device.\n\n### **How Do I Learn More?**\n\nTo zoom out on this topic, visit Appdome [All-in-One Mobile App Security](https://www.appdome.com/mobile-app-security/all-in-one-mobile-app-security/)\u00a0on our website.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to Block Magisk Manager, Prevent Rooting Android Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention/prevent-android-ios-malware/block-magisk-manager/)\n* [How to Block Magisk Manager, Prevent Rooting Android Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention/prevent-android-ios-malware/block-magisk-manager/)\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build-to-Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App\u201d, Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with thousands of security plugins and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work required.\n\n## How to Enforce Naming Policy in Mobile App Security Templates\n\nMany organizations have naming policies and standards to maintain consistency, especially when multiple team members work on the same app. Appdome allows organizations to create teams within the Appdome workflow and control their naming conventions while creating Fusion Sets templates. By enforcing a specific naming policy, you can avoid preventable mistakes, such as accidentally creating a template with an unconventional name, and complete mobile integrations efficiently.\n\nTo learn more about teams, see [How to Create Teams in Mobile DevSecOps Build System to Accelerate Delivery](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/use-team-workflows-mobile-app-security-projects/).\n\n### Prerequisites for Enforcing Naming Policies\n\nTo enforce your naming policy on your team\u2019s Fusion Sets, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u2013\u00a0[IDEAL](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/choosing-appdomes-ideal-account/) GO or higher.\n* [Appdome-GO](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-go-secure-enterprise-mobile-apps/)\n* [An Appdome Team](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/use-team-workflows-mobile-app-security-projects/)\u00a0where you are enrolled as a \u2018Leader\u2019 (Learn more about [Teams Entitlements](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/set-user-entitlements-mobile-app-security-projects/))\n\n## Steps to Enforce Naming Policies\n\n1. **Access Team Management**\n   * Click on your username at the top right of the screen.\n   * Select **Team Management**  \n     ![User Menu](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2024-05-23-at-9.49.06.png)\n2. **Open Team Details**\n   * Click on the meatballs menu of the selected team to open the **Team details.**  \n     ![Team Details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Team-Details-1300x357.png)\n3. **Set Naming Policy**\n   * Under the **Fusion Set Naming Policy**, enter the regular expression according to your organization\u2019s naming policy.  \n     For example, If you want your team names to start with a capital letter or a lowercase letter and be followed by a number from 0-9 input [A-Z][a-zA-Z]\\*[0-9]+.\n   * To check your regular expression template and familiarize yourself with regular expressions, visit [regexr.com](https://regexr.com/)  \n     ![Fusion Set Naming Policy](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fusion-Set-Naming-Policy.png)\n4. **Save Changes**\n   * Click\u00a0**Save** to apply your naming convention.\n\n**Congratulations!** Your organization naming convention is enforced on your team\u2019s Fusion sets!\n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [How to Create Teams in Mobile DevSecOps Build System to Accelerate Delivery](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appsec-release-team/create-teams-in-mobile-devsecops-build-system-to-accelerate-delivery/)\n* [How to Create and Manage Appdome Mobile App Protection Templates for Android & iOS Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/create-mobile-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n* [How to Release Mobile App Security Templates between Teams](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appsec-release-team/release-mobile-app-security-templates-between-teams/)\n* [How to Use Team Entitlements & Roles in Mobile DevSecOps Build System](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appsec-release-team/use-team-entitlements-roles-in-moible-devsecops-build-system/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.52.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.52.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)!

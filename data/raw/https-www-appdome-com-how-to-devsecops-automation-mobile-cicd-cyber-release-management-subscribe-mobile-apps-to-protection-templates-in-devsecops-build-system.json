The mobile integration lifecycle for API integration accelerates release cycles and improves mobile app delivery.\n\n### About Appdome-DEV\u2122 Mobile App Integration Automation\n\nAppdome-DEV helps you integrate your iOS and Android apps with APIs from different vendors, all in a few minutes. You can save templates with these APIs that can be applied to all of your apps built on Appdome. When you apply these templates to all apps and add new apps, they can also be subscribed to these Fusion Sets. You can also set up Build-to-Publish APIs with Appdome-DEV to automate the end-to-end mobile integration lifecycle. Typically, mobile developers work hard to add and maintain mobile API third-party services in apps. Creating continuous integration and continuous delivery is the way to improve mobile app delivery speed and quality. With Appdome, the line-by-line, manual development work required to add APIs and other services to apps is gone. This also includes any required mobile standard, framework, method, and workflow inside the mobile app. The bottom line is that developers can simply build great apps, focusing their attention on the use case and user experience needed in the app. After building the app, anyone can use Appdome to automatically add third-party services as a final step in the CI/CD workflow.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome-DEV for Mobile App Integration\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/) \u2013 IDEAL or Higher.

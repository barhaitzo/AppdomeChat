If Appdome users attempt to upload mobile applications containing DexGuard, the upload will be blocked, and you will receive a message prompting you to disable DexGuard before proceeding. This is done specifically to avoid various conflicts that certain DexGuard protections can cause if you attempt to implement Appdome.\n\n## What is DexGuard?\n\nDexGuard is a commercial tool offered by GuardSquare that provides a range of security features for Android applications (specifically code obfuscation, and some RASP, and limited encryption). It aims to protect Android apps from reverse engineering, tampering, and unauthorized access.\n\nDexGuard integrates with the Android build process and applies various transformations to the application\u2019s bytecode, making it more difficult for attackers to understand and modify the code.\n\n## Why Can\u2019t I Use DexGuard and Appdome in the same app?\n\nThe protective functionalities of DexGuard such as ptrace for anti-debugging and hook detection, conflict with the ONEShield protection mechanisms offered by Appdome. This incompatibility prevents the simultaneous use of DexGuard with Appdome\u2019s protections.\n\nWhenever an app is recognized as having DexGuard, Appdome does the following:\n\n* Displays an alert\u00a0which instructs the user on how to resolve the conflict by removing DexGuard from the build.![Image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-650x35.png)\n\n## How do I Resolve this Issue?\n\nFollow the alert instructions by removing DexGuard and upload the app again.

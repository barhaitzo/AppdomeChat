Appdome works with all leading mobile automation testing solutions to help customers achieve comprehensive mobile app security at DevSecOps speed and agility, all within the app\u2019s existing application lifecycle. Automated testing of secured Android and iOS apps helps developers and others rapidly deploy comprehensive mobile app security and fraud prevention with DevSecOps speed and agility.\n\nThis knowledge-base article covers the steps needed to test Android mobile apps secured by Appdome using Google\u2019s Firebase mobile test automation suite.\n\nUse Appdome\u2019s **Build2Test** service to test Android-protected applications on Google Firebase for **Automated testing**.  \nCustomers with an Appdome SRM license can use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service to quickly and easily test their Appdome-secured mobile apps using Google Firebase, without the need for different Fusion Sets. With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida.\n\nFor more details, see [**How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## General Information about Testing in Android Apps\n\nGoogle Firebase allows testing apps by using its App Automate features, which can be used for testing Appdome secured mobile apps.\n\nThe following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered and the reason why:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** |\n| Root Prevention | Some of Google Firebase devices are rooted |\n| Detect Developer Options | Required to interact with the device \u2013 is turned on some Firebase\u2019s devices |\n| Block Android Debug Bridge (ADB) | Required to interact with the device |\n| Block Magisk | Magisk is installed on some of the rooted devices |\n| Prevent Keystroke Injection | The vendor uses adb command to enter text Screen |\n| Click Bot Detected | Google Firebase uses automation testing with Robo Test |\n| OS Remount | OS Remount is used for changing the read/write permissions of the device\u2019s file system. |\n| Block App Overlay Attacks | Google Firebase uses a transparent or opaque UI layer above the legitimate UI layer |\n| User Denied Root Request | Appdome requests root access through an app permission request sent to the mobile user |\n\n## Testing .aab Apps\n\nUnlike .apk apps, .aab apps must be **re-signed** before installation.\n\nTo avoid triggering Appdome\u2019s Anti Tampering protection as a result of the re-signing process,\u00a0you can use\u00a0**either**\u00a0of the following options:\n\n* Use Appdome\u2019s\u00a0**Build2Test**\n* Convert the test .aab app into a Universal .apk app, using the same key that was used for signing the .aab app. Make sure to use the Universal .apk file to test Google Firebase.\n\n## Automating App Testing on Android\n\n**To initiate Automating App testing of your test app in Google Firebase**:\n\n1. [**Login to your Firebase console account**](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/).\n2. Click the\u00a0**Add Project** button from the Firebase console page.\n3. Choose a name for your project and click continue.  \n   ![Firebase Add Project](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/firebase-add-project.png)\n4. Select **Test Lab** from the left side menu .  \n   ![Firebase Test Lab](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/firebase-test-lab.png)\n5. Click\u00a0**Browse** and upload your signed app build.  \n   ![Upload Firebase](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/upload_firebase-1.png)\n6. After the app upload is complete, the test will start automatically with a compatible device.\n7. Once your app is automatically tested, you will need to wait a couple of minutes for the results.![Device Result Summary](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/device-result-summary.png)\n8. Once the test is finished, you can click on the device and view the test cycle.  \n   ![firebase Performance](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-12.02.27-1.png)\n\n**Note**: In case of any issues with the app, send the device logs to Appdome Support by following these steps:\n\n1. 1. 1. Go to **Build** > **Security** on Appdome.\n      2. Turn on the **Diagnostic Logs** toggle.  \n         For more details, see the Knowledge Base article [Appdome Diagnostic Logs for Troubleshooting Secured Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/appdome-diagnostic-logs-for-troubleshooting-secured-apps/).  \n         ![Devoptions Toggle](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/devoptions_toggle.png)\n      3. Go back to Google Firebase and re-run the steps used for uploading the app under your project.\n      4. Select **Logs**\u00a0and download it with\u00a0**V****iew log file  \n         ![Firebase-logs](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-12.07.26.png)**\n      5. Assign a name to the downloaded log, that includes the time when the issue occurred.\n      6. Send the log via email to\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)** , complete with the issue details, device model and OS version used during testing.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\nMost automation test tools can typically be used in one of two modes: **Emulator Mode** and\u00a0**Real Device** **Mode** (specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cEmulator Mode\u201d instead of \u201cReal Device Mode\u201d, the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device. This is expected because Appdome\u2019s [ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/oneshield-no-code-mobile-rasp-explained/) protects apps from running on emulators/simulators. Instead, you should run the automation test tool on a real device.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Test Secured IOS Apps on Google Firebase Robo Test](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-google-firebase-robo-test/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on Lambdatest](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-lambdatest-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [Test Appdome-secured Android Apps by Using SauceLabs](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/appsec-release-orchestration-testing-protected-mobile-apps-test-appdome-secured-android-apps-by-using-saucelabs/)\n* [Testing Secured iOS Apps by Using SauceLabs](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/testing-secure-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-saucelabs-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on BitBar](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-using-bitbar-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on Browserstack](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-on-browserstack-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

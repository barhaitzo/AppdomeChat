Designed for modern DevSecOps CI/CD Build System environments, Appdome enables mobile teams to automate and secure every step of the mobile app build process \u2013 without code, SDKs, or manual work.\n\n## Beginning a No-Code Mobile App Security Project\n\nAppdome is a unified mobile app defense platform for Android and iOS apps. With Appdome, mobile brands can integrate over 400 mobile app security features, anti-fraud measures, anti-malware protections, anti-cheat mechanisms, anti-bot defenses, geo compliance, and other security features seamlessly into the mobile DevOps pipeline. This end-to-end automation enables users to easily integrate any external feature set(s) into one or more mobile apps within minutes (sometimes seconds) through a simple point-and-click interface.\n\nWith Appdome, you can upload your mobile app binaries (in .ipa, .apk, or .aab format) into your private workspace or a team workspace associated with your account. From there, you can access [Appdome\u2019s Mobile Integration Workflow](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/using-no-code-security-android-ios-apps/) to complete your mobile integration projects.\n\nAdditionally, during the upload process, the [**Appdome Integrity Service**](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/verify-structure-integrity-android-ios-apps/) automatically verifies the integrity of your app to ensure it was built correctly.\n\n### Prerequisites to Begin a No-Code Mobile App Security Project\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to begin a no-code mobile app security project on Appdome\n\n* Appdome account ( [Create a free Appdome account here](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* Mobile App\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n### How to Upload Any Mobile App to Appdome\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to upload your app to Appdome.\n\n1. Select your Personal Workspace\n2. Click on the\u00a0**+ Start** button.  \n   ![Click +Start](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-2024-06-04-at-15.19.32.png)\n3. Click on Upload App  \n   ![Upload App](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-2024-06-04-at-15.24.44-1300x625.png)\n4. Click the + sign and browse for a file, as seen below. Alternatively, drag a file to the dialog box.  \n   ![Myapppicking](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/myAppPicking-611x366.png)\n5. A progress bar appears to display the upload process.  \n   ![Progress bar upload process](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-07-05-at-14.33.19-563x366.png)\n6. After the upload process is completed successfully, you can integrate your uploaded app with Appdome\u2019s mobile integration platform by clicking **Let\u2019s start building**.  \n   ![Start building](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2023-07-05-at-14.33.46-563x366.png)\n\n## Integrating Security Features: Manual Method vs. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n#### Manual Method\n\n1. **Upload Your App**: Follow the steps outlined above.\n2. **Toggle On Security Features**: Use Appdome\u2019s point-and-click interface to select the desired security features.\n3. [**Create and Save Fusion Set**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/manage-fusion-set-security-templates-iosandroid/): Save your configurations into a Fusion Set.\n4. [**Sign the App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/automatic-code-signing-for-secured-android-apps-on-appdome/): Use your signing credentials to sign the app (For iOS, a P12 File, Provision Profile, and Entitlement list are required, and for Android, a Keystore file is required).\n5. **Click Build My App**: This will initiate the building process with the selected security features.\n\n#### CI/CD Pipeline Method\n\n1. **Upload Your App**: Follow the steps outlined above.\n2. **Toggle On Security Features**: Use Appdome\u2019s point-and-click interface to select the desired security features.\n3. **Create and Save Fusion Set**: Save your configurations into a Fusion Set.\n4. **Copy Fusion Set ID, [Appdome API Token](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-and-resetting-your-api-token), and Build2Secure Plugin**:\n   * These details can be integrated into your chosen CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, GitLab, Bitrise, GitHub, etc.).\n\n### Detailed CI/CD Integration Guides\n\nFor specific instructions on integrating Appdome with various CI/CD systems, refer to the following articles:\n\n* [Jenkins](https://www.appdome.com/press-release/appdome-releases-build-2secure-jenkins-plugin-to-automate-delivery-of-secure-mobile-apps/)\n* [TeamCity](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/build-2secure-in-teamcity/)\n* [Bamboo](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/secure-android-ios-apps-in-bamboo-ci-cd/)\n* [GitLab](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/use-appdome-build-2secure-in-gitlab/)\n* [Bitrise](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/secure-android-ios-apps-in-bitrise-ci-cd-pipelines/)\n* [GitHub](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/use-appdomes-github-action/)\n* [Azure](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/use-appdome-build-2secure-in-azure-pipelines/)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [Using Certified Secure\u2122 Android & iOS Apps Build Certification in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/security-release-management/using-certified-secure-android-ios-apps-build-certification-in-devops-cicd/)\n* [How to Automate Secure iOS App Code Signing in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/code-signing-secure-android-ios/automate-secure-ios-app-code-signing-in-devops-cicd/)\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps in Bitrise CI/CD Pipelines](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/secure-android-ios-apps-in-bitrise-ci-cd-pipelines/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

To make this easier, we have created [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collections of the available requests.\u00a0 To use it, download the following json files:\n\n* [Appdome-DEV API for Postman](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ukb7l2620yrz70z/Appdome%20DEV%20API_NEW.postman_collection.json?dl=0) [Collection](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ukb7l2620yrz70z/Appdome%20DEV%20API_NEW.postman_collection.json?dl=0) \u2013 includes the REST APIs of Appdome\u2019s single tasks and the REST APIs to audit app secured teams.\n* [Appdome-Team Management\u00a0API for Postman Collection](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f19my77ufqb0x35/Teams%20Management%20API.postman_collection.json?dl=0) \u2013 includes the REST APIs of Appdome\u2019s management REST APIs for company secured teams.\n* [Appdome-User Management API for Postman Collection](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o52b0s0xlx68q3f/Users%20Management%20API.postman_collection.json?dl=0) \u2013 includes the REST APIs of Appdome\u2019s management REST APIs for company users.\n\n## What is Postman?\n\nPostman is an API client tool that helps with testing. It lets you configure requests and send them with various controls and environment set-ups.\n\nThis knowledge base will introduce our collection and some basic functions of Postman. For more about using postman, see\u00a0[Postman Learning Center](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates/).\n\nBefore using the Appdome Postman collection, please read more about [Appdome-DEV REST API](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/automate-building-mobile-apps-appdome-rest-api/) and [Appdome-Management REST API](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/how-to-automate-management-tasks-using-the-appdome-management-rest-api).\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features to Android and iOS apps without coding. \u00a0Appdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps. When an Appdome user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\n## How to Test CI/CD with Postman API for App Security Projects\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome-DEV\u2122 Build-to-Publish API\n\n1. Install\u00a0 [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)\u00a0on your workstation.\n2. Download one or all the postman collections above.\n3. Gather Appdome user API token or app team API key\n   1. Log in to Appdome.\n   2. Click your name on the top right-hand corner > My Profile.\n   3. Copy your API Token.  \n      ![test Mobile App Security APIs with a CI/CD system using Postman](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Presentation1-1.png)\n4. Gather Fusion Set API Key.  \n   ![integrating appdome Mobile App Security APIs with a CI/CD systems ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-1.30.22-PM.png)  \n   ![test Mobile App Security APIs with a CI/CD system using Postman](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AppFusion_Platform-379x366.png)\n\n### Importing the Collection to Postman\n\n1. Launch Postman and click Import.  \n   ![test Mobile App Security APIs with a CI/CD system using Postman](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Presentation2-553x366.png)\n2. Choose the downloaded collection file/s.  \n   ![test Mobile App Security APIs with a CI/CD system using Postman](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-12-18-at-12.15.51-PM.png)\n3. Within your added collection, click the Manage Environments button.  \n   ![postman API](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Presentation3.png)\n4. First,\u00a0[Get your API Token, Team\u2019s API Key (if needed) and Fusion Set API key](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/automate-building-mobile-apps-appdome-rest-api/).  \n   Enter Server Name, Authorization, and team\\_id.  \n   \u2013 To make testing easy, we recommend setting up environments to hold your Authorization token and if building on App Teams your Appdome account\u2019s Team API Keys (if you have multiple Appdome accounts or teams, you can set up multiple environments.)![Postman API testing](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-12-18-at-12.32.35-PM.png)\n5. Select your environment from the drop-down.\n\n### Setting Up an Environment for Appdome\u2019s REST API\n\nVariables defined in the environment set up will replace parameters such as\u00a0`{{Authorization}}`on run time:\n\n![test Mobile App Security APIs with a CI/CD system using Postman](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-12-18-at-1.16.26-PM.png)\n\nThe collection is added to your library:\n\n* Expand the Appdome DEV API Collection to see all task requests.\n* A folder with a series of Tasks for individual steps with your Appdome user account.\n* A folder for Teams requests (logs and information) can be added and found here for app teams.\n\n![appdome Mobile App Security ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Presentation4-256x366.png)\n\n### Configuring Requests\n\nBefore sending a request, you need to configure its parameters, body content, and variables.\n\nFirst, select the request on the Library.\n\nOn the **Params** tab, you can add URL-encoded parameters. Team\\_id is configured is this way.\n\n1. If you want to send the request to a Team, **check** the team\\_id key (to send it in the request, and make sure team\\_id is configured in the environment or defined in the value column.)\n2. Notice that\u00a0`?team_id={{team_id}}`is added to the request URL.\n\n* If you want to send the request to the Appdome account API Token owner, **uncheck** the team\\_id key.\n\n![test Mobile App Security APIs with a CI/CD system using Postman](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-12-18-at-1.24.18-PM.png)\n\nOn the **Body** tab, you can configure the body of the request. Depending on the request, you can:\n\n1. Enter required or optional **form data values** (such as app\\_id, provisioning profile)\n2. **Upload files** (app, provisioning profile)\n3. Edit the\u00a0`overrides`\u00a0**JSON content**\n\n* Make sure to use the checkboxes to turn on/off the desired keys.\n* Note the Description field for more information. Some fields may be mandatory for iOS but invalid for Android etc.\n\nOn the **Pre-request Script Tab**, you can configure variables that need to be inserted into the URL. This is currently only relevant for the GET requests: Task-Download and Task-Status.\n\nThese requests need to pass the task\\_id in the URL. In the Pre-request Script tab, **insert** the task is as the value:\u00a0`pm.environment.set(\"task_id\", \"<task_id>\");`\n\n![test Mobile App Security APIs with a CI/CD system using Postman](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Postman_KB_8_Pre_script.png)\n\n### Sending Requests\n\nOnce the request is configured, click **Send**. The response will appear below.\n\n![Postman Kb 9 Sendandresponse](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Postman_KB_9_sendAndResponse-1-533x366.png)\n\nFor the Task-Download, click the arrow and select **Send and Download**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Postman_KB_10_sendAndDownload.png)\n\n### How Do I Learn More\n\nCheck out\u00a0[Appdome Platform](https://appdome.com/platform/), [Appdome-DEV](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/), or\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

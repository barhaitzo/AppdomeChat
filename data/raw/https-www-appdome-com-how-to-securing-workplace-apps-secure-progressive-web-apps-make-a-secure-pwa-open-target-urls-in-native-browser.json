Simply input an existing URL into Appdome\u2019s app builder, select your choice of platform (Android, iOS, or cross-platform), and click Convert To App. Within minutes, the Appdome platform automatically converts the website into a mobile application that will run natively on any mobile device for the platform you selected.\n\nOnce you have created your mobile application, you can optionally implement your choice of Appdome mobile app security features and build your custom security model directly into the app \u2013 all within the same no-code workflow.\n\n## 5 Easy Steps Open Target URLs In Native Browser\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to build a Secure PWA that will open target URLs using the phone\u2019s native browser (Android in this case).\n\n1. From the **Add App** tab, Select **Create Secure PWA\u2122** and enter the **website address** for the website you wish to convert (Note, enter the full address, and ensure that the URL is reachable).\n2.

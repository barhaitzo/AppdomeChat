At Appdome, we want to ensure your mobile app security testing and security release processes for new operating systems are smooth and efficient.\n\nIn general, Apple and Google release new GA versions of new operating systems in calendar Q3 of each year. Beta versions are made available to developers beginning in Q2 of each year. Minor versions of mobile OSs are also released throughout the year. Appdome uses the same process for major and minor versions.\n\nAppdome obtains the new beta versions of Android and iOS operating systems when they are released to the OS vendor\u2019s developer community. Appdome\u2019s engineering and security research team reviews each beta version and begins testing each beta version to ensure compatibility with customer apps and use cases.\n\n![iOS Fusion Set Os Coverage](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-2024-10-08-at-10.27.20.png)\n\n## Appdome Mobile OS Beta Testing & Release Program\n\nAppdome strives to be GA (General Availability) ready with all mobile app security and fraud detection features on the same day as each new operating system\u2019s GA date.\n\nTo ensure that all Appdome-secured customer apps and use cases are tested, ready, and compatible with each new mobile operating system, Appdome developed and released this Mobile OS Beta Testing & Release Program.\n\nStarting with 2nd beta version (i.e., Beta 2) of each new beta version of Android and iOS, Appdome invites customers to participate in its innovation and release cycle for new Android and iOS versions by testing the compatibility of the latest beta version of Android and iOS with secured versions of customer apps based on each customer\u2019s class of license and/or service contract (i.e., Appdome DEV PLUS / SRM or Appdome Ideal). All customers are encouraged to participate in compatibility testing starting with Beta 2. Appdome initially provides feedback to customer inquiries, followed by Beta and GA Codebases released by Appdome based on the schedule below:\n\n| Apple iOS\\* | Appdome Dev Plus / SRM | Appdome Dev | Appdome Ideal Partner | Appdome Ideal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Beta 1 | Feedback |  |  |  |\n| Beta 2 | Feedback | Feedback | Feedback | Feedback |\n| Beta 3 | Beta Codebase | Feedback | Feedback | Feedback |\n| Beta 4 | Beta Codebase | Beta Codebase | Feedback | Feedback |\n| General Availability | GA Codebase | GA Codebase | GA Codebase | GA Codebase |\n\n* iOS beta apps must be built with the GA version of Xcode\n\n| Google Android | Appdome Dev Plus / SRM | Appdome Dev | Appdome Ideal Partner | Appdome Ideal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Beta 1 | Feedback |  |  |  |\n| Beta 2 | Feedback | Feedback | Feedback | Feedback |\n| Beta 3 | Beta Codebase | Feedback | Feedback | Feedback |\n| General Availability | GA Codebase | GA Codebase | GA Codebase | GA Codebase |\n\nAppdome encourages Appdome DEV PLUS / SRM and Appdome DEV customers to test and provide feedback to Appdome as early as practical.\n\n**Note: Appdome also encourages customers not to try to preemptively release beta OS versions of their apps too far in advance of the release date of the GA versions of Android and iOS released by the mobile OS vendor. Mobile operating systems can change significantly in the final weeks of each new operating system\u2019s release cycle.**\n\nAll customers using Appdome\u2019s no-code Secure SDK Delivery\u2122 service who have not otherwise purchased an Appdome-DEV or higher license from Appdome are included in the account class Ideal-Partner. For these customers, we invite you to begin your testing based on the charts above. Please note that the availability of an Android and/or iOS-compatible SDK may be required from the SDK vendor.\n\nNew mobile OS releases are exciting times for everyone. Appdome looks forward to working with its customers on each release cycle!\n\n## How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.6.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [Appdome Support and EOL Policies for Mobile OSs and SDKs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-os-compatibility/appdome-support-and-eol-policies-for-mobile-oss-and-sdks/)\n* [Appdome Support Policy for Mobile App Architectures and Processors](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-os-compatibility/appdome-support-policy-for-mobile-app-architectures-and-processors/)\n* [Appdome Compatibility Guidelines](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-os-compatibility/appdome-compatibility-guidelines/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

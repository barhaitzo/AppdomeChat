However, when developers use AVPlayer inside iOS mobile apps, it often presents several challenges for EMM tunnels, including performance and stability of the connection. Appdome offers **SmartMediaTM\u00a0Routing**, which enables Media Player streaming and media files to be sent over any secured EMM Tunnel for any mobile application. This Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for how to get media players to work with EUM MDM VPN tunnel.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Get Media Players to Work with UEM MDM VPN Tunnel\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nUsers merely upload a mobile app, select the EMM and SmartMediaTM Routing feature, and click \u201cBuild My App.\u201d The Appdome technology automatically adds the secured EMM tunnel, SmartMediaTM Routing and more automatically, with no manual development work at all. Using Appdome, mobile apps using AVPlayer will send their media files through the EMM tunnel and access secure internal resources as if the capabilities were natively coded into the application.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome for SmartMediaTM Routing\u00a0for EMM Tunneling\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of SmartMediaTM\u00a0Routing on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher.\n* [Appdome-DEV access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* [iOS Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\n* EMM environment (for any of the Appdome supported EMMs)  \n  *Note: Discover more about the\u00a0[EMMs on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/knowledgebase-category/appdome-for-enterprise-mobility-management/)*\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## The Easy Steps to Get Media Players to Work with UEM MDM VPN Tunnel\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add\u00a0SmartMediaTM Routing for EMM Tunneling to any Mobile App:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n### From the Build tab, select Management\n\n1. Under\u00a0**Enterprise Mobility Management**enable or toggle \u201cON\u201d\u00a0**EMM Services**\n2. From the EMM vendor drop-down list, select your EMM service\n\n![Service Selection](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/service-selection.png)\n\n1. Under\u00a0**Appdome Mobility Suite** expands the **Adaptive App Routing** category\n2. Enable [**Route all Traffic**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/get-mobile-apps-work-eum-mdm-vpn-tunnel/) (default) or [**Inclusive Routing**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/get-mobile-apps-work-eum-mdm-vpn-tunnel/)\n3. Enable or toggle \u201cON\u201d ****SmartMediaTM Routing****\n\n![Appdome Mobility Suite ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/appdome-mobility-suite_-1.png)\n\n* Click **Build My App**\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each application and match the application to the relevant code-sets needed to add SmartMediaTM Routing and EMM tunneling to the mobile app in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!** Once Appdome has finished your mobile integration project (usually in 30 seconds), you\u2019ll see the notification below. You now have a mobile app fully integrated with SmartMediaTM Routing and the EMM Tunnel from your selected EMM vendor.\n\n![Screenshot 2024 01 17 At 12.55.08](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2024-01-17-at-12.55.08.png)\n\n## After Adding\u00a0SmartMediaTM Routing\u00a0to a Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAfter you have added\u00a0SmartMediaTM Routing to any mobile app on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome Built App\n\nAppdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform.

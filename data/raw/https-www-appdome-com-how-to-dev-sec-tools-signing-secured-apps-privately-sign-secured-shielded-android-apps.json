All Android applications must be digitally signed before they can be installed or distributed through app stores.\n\nWhen Appdome\u2019s security features are added to an app during the Build process, the app\u2019s original signature is invalidated. As a result, the protected app must be re-signed before it can be deployed to devices. Appdome supports multiple signing workflows, allowing apps to be re-signed directly on Appdome, within a customer\u2019s secure environment, or through Auto-DEV Private Signing for CI/CD use cases.\n\n### Trusted Signing Certificates\n\nAppdome uses a **Trusted Signing** model to validate Android app signing based on authorized certificate fingerprints, rather than distribution-specific signing options. Customers explicitly define which signing certificates are trusted, and **any app signed with one of these certificates is considered valid and will not trigger anti-tampering protections.** This unified approach replaces previous toggle-based signing behavior and enables the same app build to be used consistently across production, testing, and enterprise distribution workflows.\n\n**Trusted Store Signing** is an optional compatibility setting used to preserve existing store-based validation behavior. Most customers do not need to modify this setting unless instructed by Appdome Support.\n\n##### Before You Begin\n\nEnsure the following prerequisites are met:\n\n* Your app is built with Appdome\u2019s features and is ready to be signed\n* You have the following:\n\n  + Keystore file\n  + Keystore password\n  + Key alias\n  + Key password\n\nLearn how to\u00a0[generate a keystore and an upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#generate-key)\u00a0in Android Studio.\n\n##### Additional requirements apply depending on the signing method:\n\n* **Private Signing** and **Auto-DEV Private Signing** require at least one **SHA-1 or SHA-256** certificate fingerprint.\n* When using **Sign on Appdome**, a **SHA-1 or SHA-256** certificate fingerprint is optional.\n* (Optional) Prepare annotations to help identify certificate usage (for example, store-level or CI/CD signing).\n* If no annotation is provided, Appdome may display a **\u201cMissing Annotation\u201d** warning with an **orange icon** (informational only)  \n  [![Missing Annotation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Missing_Annotation-1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Missing_Annotation-1.png)\n\n### Sign on Appdome \u2013 Step by Step:\n\n1. Select and APK/AAB app you\u2019d like to sign (the app needs to complete the Build process with Appdome for you to be able to sign it)\n2. In the upper navigation bar, select **Sign**.\n3. Next to \u201cHow Would You Like to Sign?\u201d, select **On Appdome**.\n4. Under **Trusted Signing Certificates**, add a **SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint**.\n   * This is **required** when the app will be re-signed by another signing authority (for example, Google Play).\n   * For more information, see [the following Appdome knowledge base article.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-app-with-sha-fingerprint-google-cert-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n5. (Optional) Add an **Annotation** to document certificate usage.\n6. (Optional) Select the **Trusted Store Signing** checkbox, if instructed by Appdome Support.\n7. Select **Sign My App**.\n8. (Optional) In the pop-up message, select **OK** to save your signing credentials, or **Skip** to proceed without saving.\n\nAppdome will now calculate a [checksum](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-and-app-shielding/running-a-checksum-validation-of-android-and-ios-apps/) of each component of your app\u2019s current state. Once the signing is complete, continue to the next step to deploy your app.\n\nSign **On Appdome:**\n\n[![Android Sign On Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome.png)\n\n(Optional) Under **Trusted Signing Certificates**, click **+** to add a **SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint:**\n\n[![Android Sign On Appdome W Sha1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome_W_SHA1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome_W_SHA1.png)\n\n### Private Signing\n\nYou can sign the app in your trusted environment using private signing, described next.\n\n##### Before You Begin\n\nEnsure the following prerequisites are met:\n\n* Your app is built with Appdome\u2019s features and is ready to be signed\n* Your SDK Build Tools version must be [35.0.0 or later](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).\n\n  + This version includes required updates to `apksigner` and supports **16KB ZIP alignment**, which is required for properly packaging APKs for modern Android versions.\n  + Using older Build Tools or older alignment values (such as 4KB) may result in improperly signed APKs that fail to install or update on newer Android devices.\n* The Java version in your local environment is equal to or newer than the version used to generate your keystore\n\n  + To verify, run the following command on your terminal: `java -version`\n* You have access to your **Android signing keystore**\n* At least one **SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint** is available for Private Signing\n\n1. Generate a Certificate Fingerprint\n\nLocal signing of the app may fail if the certificate fingerprint you provide doesn\u2019t match its associated keystore, as Appdome validates signing integrity using Trusted Signing certificates.  \nTo get the fingerprint, follow these steps:\n\n##### Step by Step:\n\n1. On your workstation, run:\n\n   ```\n   keytool -list -v -keystore <path_to_keystore> -storepass <store pass> -alias <alias>\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, use this command:\n\n   ```\n   keytool -printcert -jarfile <apk/aab_file>\n   ```\n\n   The SHA1 or the SHA256 of the signature will be marked inside the output.\u00a0 This is a public identifier that can also be extracted from the signed .apk. The output should look like this:\n\n   ```\n   test-alias, Nov 20, 2017, PrivateKeyEntry, \r\n   Certificate fingerprint (SHA1):BE:D2:E3:17:9F:20:9A:F9:CF:55:E8:31:21:8C:7E:C7:7F:87:62:26\n   ```\n2. Copy the fingerprint.\n\n##### 2. Seal The App in Appdome\n\n##### Step by step:\n\n1. Select the **APK or AAB** you want to sign (the app must complete the Build process to be sealed).\n2. In the upper navigation bar, select **Sign**.\n3. Next to **How Would You Like to Sign?**, select **Private Signing**.\n4. Under **Trusted Signing Certificates**, click + to add a SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint\n5. (Optional) Add an Annotation to document certificate usage.\n6. (Optional) Select the Trusted Store Signing checkbox\n7. Select **Sign Privately**.\n8. In the pop-up message, select **Continue with Private Signing**.\n9. (Optional) Select the checkbox to save your signing credentials.\n\n[![Android Private Sign Appdome1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Private_Sign_Appdome1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Private_Sign_Appdome1.png)\n\n\n\n##### 3. Sign the App Privately\n\nUse the set of instructions below that matches your app type: APK or AAB.\n\n##### Signing an APK App\n\n##### Step by Step:\n\nAfter downloading the built app from Appdome, you must align the APK using **16KB ZIP alignment** before signing to ensure compatibility with modern Android packaging requirements. You can sign the app on your workstation by running:\n\n```\nzipalign -P 16 -f 4 <path_to_apk> <path_to_apk>-aligned.apk\n```\n\n```\nmv <path_to_apk>-aligned.apk <path_to_apk>\n```\n\n```\napksigner sign --ks <path_to_keystore> --ks-pass pass:<store pass> --ks-key-alias <alias> --key-pass pass:<key pass> --v2-signing-enabled --v1-signing-enabled <path_to_apk>\n```\n\nAfter signing, your app is ready to deploy.\n\n##### Signing an AAB App\n\n##### Step by Step:\n\nOnce you have downloaded the Built app from Appdome, you can sign the app on your workstation by running:\n\n```\njarsigner <path_to_AAB> -sigalg SHA256withRSA -digestalg SHA-256 -keystore <path_to_keystore> <alias> -storepass <store pass> -keypass <key pass> -signedjar signed_AAB.aab\n```\n\nAfter signing, your app is ready to deploy.\n\n## Auto-DEV Private Signing\n\nAuto-DEV Private Signing allows you to seal the app in Appdome and complete signing automatically in your own environment using a local signing script. This workflow is designed for CI/CD pipelines and requires a trusted certificate fingerprint to validate signing integrity.\n\n##### Before You Begin\n\nEnsure the following prerequisites are met:\n\n* Your app is built with Appdome\u2019s features and is ready to be signed\n* Your SDK Build Tools version must be [35.0.0 or later](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).\n\n  + This version includes required updates to `apksigner` (16KB alignment and ZIP alignment metadata)\n  + Using older versions may result in improperly signed APKs that fail to install or update\n* The Java version in your local environment is equal to or newer than the version used to generate your keystore\n\n  + To verify, run the following command on your terminal: `java -version`\n* You have access to your **Android signing keystore**\n* At least one **SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint** is available for Auto-Dev Private Signing\n\n### Environment Requirements\n\nAuto-DEV Private Signing uses a local signing script and requires specific tools to be available in your environment.\n\n**macOS / Linux**\n\n* Python 3.6 or later\n* `keytool` (JDK 1.8 or later)\n* `zipalign` (Android SDK Build Tools 35.0.0 or later)\n* `apksigner` (Android SDK Build Tools)\n\n**Windows**\n\n* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\n* A Linux distribution supporting OpenJDK 8 (for example, Ubuntu)\n* Python 3.6 or later\n\n##### Step by step:\n\n1. Extract the **SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint** from your signing keystore.\n2. Select the **APK or AAB** you want to sign (the app must complete the Build process).\n3. In the upper navigation bar, select **Sign**.\n4. Next to **How Would You Like to Sign?**, select **Auto-DEV Private Signing**.\n5. Under **Trusted Signing Certificates**, click + to add a SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint\n6. (Optional) Add an Annotation to document certificate usage.\n7. (Optional) Select the Trusted Store Signing checkbox\n8. Select Auto-DEV Sign Privately.\n9. In the pop-up message, select **Continue with Private Signing**.\n10. (Optional) Select the checkbox to save your signing credentials.\n11. Once sealing is complete, download the app and the generated signing script.\n\n[![Android Auto Dev Private Sign Appdome1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Auto_Dev_Private_Sign_Appdome1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Auto_Dev_Private_Sign_Appdome1.png)\n\n## Post-Sign Indicator\n\nAfter signing, Appdome displays signing and validation details to help verify that the app was signed using the expected certificates and configuration.\n\nThe following information may be displayed in the Certified Secure\u2122 Certificate:\n\n* **SHA-1 / SHA-256 certificate fingerprints**\n* **Annotation** (if provided)\n* **Trusted Store Signing** indicator (if enabled)\n\n[![Myandroidapp Certificate1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MyAndroidApp-Certificate1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MyAndroidApp-Certificate1.png)\n\n## How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[**support.appdome.com**](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1716710009283.1716714473539.364&__hssc=79098507.3.1716714473539&__hsfp=2335033740 \"http://support.appdome.com/\")\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Using a local Appdome supplied script](/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-ios-apps-using-a-local-appdome-supplied-script/)\n* [How to Code Sign Secured iOS Apps in DevSecOps Build System](/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/code-sign-secured-ios-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n* [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Using Codesign](/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-ios-apps-using-codesign/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1716710009283.1716714473539.364&__hssc=79098507.3.1716714473539&__hsfp=2335033740 \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

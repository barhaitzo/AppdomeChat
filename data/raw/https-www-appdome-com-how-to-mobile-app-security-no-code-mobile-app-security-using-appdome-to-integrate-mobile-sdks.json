An SDK will typically include APIs, can include debugging tools and often provide code samples and detailed documentation to assist with implementation and development at the source code level.\n\nSDKs are typically specific to a particular vendor.\u00a0A vendor may provide more than one SDK, each covering a specific mobile service. Each SDK is likely to have several variants for different operating systems (iOS, Android and Windows), programming languages, and development frameworks (Maui, Xamarin, Kony, SAP, Cordova, Ionic, etc.).\u00a0In short, complexity can be a challenge, even for the same mobile service.\n\nTo provide the integrations that enterprise customers demand, a single mobile app may need to be integrated with the same mobile service from different vendors.\u00a0Each vendor will provide its own set of SDKs for the mobile developer to implement. Each implementation will require the developer to create a new version of the app, specific to that SDK. For a mobile developer, integrating a single SDK at the source code level can be a lot of work. Imagine having to integrate multiple SDKs across versions, frameworks, operating systems and the like.\n\n## The Case for Using Appdome to Integrate Mobile SDKs\n\nAppdome eliminates the need to implement the SDK in the source code. Fusing also allows an SDK to be implemented by anyone with access to the app binary and the Appdome platform.\n\nAppdome increases and extends the value of mobile SDKs. Appdome makes a mobile SDK much more accessible because, using Appdome, it can be combined directly to app binaries. To integrate mobile SDKs, Appdome requires no coding or source code access. As a result, Appdome removes platform and framework dependencies, saves time and enables mobile organizations\u00a0to utilize scarce mobile development resources optimally. Citizen mobile integrators can implement mobile SDKs.\n\nTo zoom out on this topic, visit the\u00a0Appdome Platform section on our website.\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

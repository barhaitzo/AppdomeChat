Common attack techniques include reverse engineering, tampering, and dynamic analysis. Attackers also often repackage and re-sign apps, modifying code to steal login credentials, intercept transactions, access sensitive data, and more. AI-powered tools also may further simplify reverse engineering by automatically identifying security mechanisms and suggesting the best points of attack within the app\u2019s runtime environment, making it harder to protect mobile apps using traditional approaches that require manually coded or implemented solutions.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Mobile Apps with App Shielding\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic App Shielding plugins for Android defends against code tampering, reverse engineering, and unauthorized app modifications by applying multiple layers of runtime security. It continuously monitors the app environment for threats such as debugger attachment, code injection, tampering with app binaries, or attempts to extract sensitive app data. The plugin detects these attacks in real time and triggers responses like closing the app to prevent further activity. Integrated seamlessly, it ensures robust, automated protection without requiring developer input. Mobile developers can leverage Appdome\u2019s Threat-Events\u2122 to collect detailed data on app shielding events and tailor in-app responses based on detected threats.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Appdome's App Shielding Plugins:\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s mobile app security build system to  **Use App Shielding** , you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **App Shielding**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see [**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n## How to Implement Use App Shielding in Mobile Apps Using Appdome\n\nOn Appdome, follow these  **simple steps** to create self-defending Mobile Apps that **Use App Shielding** without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1. ### [**Designate**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) the Mobile App to be protected.\n\n   1. #### Upload an app via the Appdome Mobile Defense platform GUI or via Appdome\u2019s DEV-API or CI/CD Plugins.\n   2. **Mobile App Formats:** .ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android\n   3. **App Shielding is compatible with:**\n      Obj-C, Java, JS, C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, and more.\n2. ### Select the defense: **App Shielding**.****\n\n   1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the App Shielding feature as shown below:\n\n      ![fusion set that contains App Shielding](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/android_fs_image.png)\n\n      Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the App Shielding feature\n\n      1. Follow the steps in Sections [2.2-2.2.2](#2.2) of this article to add the App Shielding feature to your Fusion Set via the Appdome Console.\n      2. When you enable ONEShield\u2122 by Appdome you'll notice that the Fusion Set you created in step 2.1 now bears the icon of the protection category that contains App Shielding.\n\n         ![Fusion Set applied App Shielding](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Saved_Fusion_Set_For_App_Shielding.png)\n\n         Figure 2: Fusion Set that displays the newly added App Shielding protection\n           \n         Note: Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n      3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c...\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set. Copy\n         the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):\n         ![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/copy_fs_id.png)\n\n         Figure 3: Fusion Set Detail Summary\n      4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI or other system:\n         1. Refer to the [Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link) for API building instructions.\n         2. Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python).\n   2. #### Add the **App Shielding** feature to your security template.\n\n      1. Navigate to **Build**  > **Security** tab > **ONEShield\u2122** section in the Appdome Console.\n\n         Like all other options in ONEShield\u2122, App Shielding is turned on by default, as shown below:\n         ![App Shielding option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Appdome_OneShield_App_Shielding-_Checkmark.png)\n\n         Figure 4: Selecting App Shielding   \n         Note: The App Compromise Notification contains an easy to follow default remediation path for the mobile app end user. You can customize this message as required to achieve brand specific support, workflow or other messaging.\n\n      - Toggle On **ONEShield\u2122 by Appdome** > **App Shielding**.\n          \n        Note: The checkmark feature App Shielding is enabled by default, as shown below.\n\n        (a) Choose to monitor this attack vector by checking the Threat Events\n        checkbox associated with **App Shielding** as shown below.\n\n          \n\n        (b) To receive mobile Threat Monitoring, check the ThreatScope\u2122 box as shown below.\n        For more details, see our knowledge base article on [ThreatScope\u2122 Mobile XTM](/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-xtm/).\n\n        ![App Shielding option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Appdome_OneShield_App_Shielding-_Checkmark.png)\n\n        Figure 4: Selecting Use App Shielding\n\n        Note:  The Appdome Platform displays the Mobile Operation Systems supported by each defense in real-time.\n        For more details, see our [OS Support Policy KB](/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-os-compatibility/appdome-support-and-eol-policies-for-mobile-oss-and-sdks/).\n\n      2. Select the Threat-Event\u2122 in-app mobile **Threat Defense and Intelligence** policy for **App Shielding**:  \n         1. **Threat-Events\u2122 OFF > In-App Defense** \n\n            If the Threat-Events\u2122 setting is not selected.\n            Appdome will detect and defend user and app by enforcing App Shielding.\n         2. **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > In-App Detection**\n\n            When this setting is used, Appdome detects Unauthorized patching, tampering, repackaging, and code signing. and passes Appdome\u2019s Threat-Event\u2122 attack intelligence to the app\u2019s business logic for processing, enforcement, and user notification.\n            For more information on consuming and using Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 in the app, see section Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Use App Shielding Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps.\n         3. **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > In-App Defense**\n\n            When this setting is used, Appdome detects and defends against App Shielding (same as Appdome Enforce) and passes Appdome\u2019s Threat-Event\u2122 attack intelligence to the app\u2019s business logic for processing.\n            For more information on consuming and using Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 in the app, see section Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Use App Shielding Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps.\n      3. Configure the User Experience Options for **App Shielding**:\n           \n         With Threat-Events\u2122 OFF, Appdome provides several user experience options for mobile brands and developers.\n         1. App Compromise Notification: Customize the pop-up or toast Appdome uses to notify the user when a threat is present while using the protected mobile app.\n         2. Short message Option. This is available for mobile devices that allow a banner notification for security events.\n         3. Localized Message Option. Allows Appdome users to support global languages in security notifications.\n\n            ![Localized Message](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/localized_message.png)\n\n            Figure 5: Default User Experience Options for Appdome\u2019s **App Shielding**\n         4. **App Shielding** Threat Code\u2122. Appdome uses AI to generate a unique code each time\n            **App Shielding** is triggered by an active threat on the mobile device.\n            Use the code in Appdome Threat Resolution Center\u2122 to help end users identify, find and resolve active threats on the personal mobile devices.\n   3. Initiate the build command either by clicking **Build My App** at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in Figure 4)\n      or via your CI/CD as described in Section [2.1.4](#2.1.4).\n\n   **Congratulations!** The App Shielding protection is now added to the mobile app\n3. ### **Certify the App Shielding feature in Mobile Apps**\n\n   After building App Shielding, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the App Shielding protection has been added and is protecting the app. To verify that the App Shielding protection has been added to the mobile app, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:\n   ![App Shielding shown in Certificate secure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Certified_Secure_Certificate_for_One_Shield-2.png)\n\n   Figure 6: Certified Secure\u2122 certificate\n\n   Each Certified Secure\u2122 certificate provides DevOps and DevSecOps organizations the entire workflow summary, audit trail of each build, and proof of protection that App Shielding has been added to each Mobile app. Certified Secure provides instant and in-line DevSecOps compliance certification that App Shielding and other mobile app security features are in each build of the mobile app.\n\n## Using Threat-Events\u2122 for App Shielding Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps\n\nAppdome Threat-Events\u2122 provides consumable in-app mobile app attack intelligence and defense control when **App Shielding** is detected. To consume and use Threat-Events\u2122 for\nApp Shielding in Mobile Apps, use AddObserverForName in Notification Center, and the code samples for Threat-Events\u2122 for App Shielding shown below.\n\nThe specifications and options for Threat-Events\u2122 for App Shielding are:\n\nThreat-Event\u2122 Elements | Use App Shielding Method Detail || Appdome Feature Name | App Shielding |\n| Threat-Event Mode | |\n| OFF, IN-APP DEFENSE | Appdome detects, defends and notifies user (standard OS dialog) using customizable messaging. |\n| ON, IN-APP DETECTION | Appdome detects the attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (app chooses how and when to enforce). |\n| ON, IN-APP DEFENSE | Uses Appdome Enforce mode for any attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (gather intel on attacks and threats without losing any protection). |\n| Certified Secure\u2122 Threat Event Check |  |\n| Visible in ThreatScope\u2122 |  |\n| Developer Parameters for Using App Shielding Threat-Event\u2122 | |\n| Threat-Event **NAME** | AppIntegrityError |\n| Threat-Event **DATA** | reasonData |\n| Threat-Event **CODE** | reasonCode |\n| Threat-Event **REF** | 6917 |\n| Threat-Event **SCORE** | || currentThreatEventScore | Current Threat-Event score |\n| threatEventsScore | Total Threat-events score |\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| carrierPlmn | PLMN of the device.

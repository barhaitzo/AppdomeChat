Each agent uses Appdome\u2019s unified data, threat intelligence, and build context to provide precise insights, recommendations, and actions tailored to each mobile brand. Together, they help cyber, fraud, DevOps, support, and engineering teams understand threats faster, resolve issues efficiently, and maintain a strong, compliant defense posture at scale. All agents operate inside Appdome\u2019s secure enterprise framework, ensuring safe, governed use of AI without exposing data to public models.\n\n[![All Agents](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/All-Agents.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/All-Agents.png)\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome\u2019s AI Agent Team:\n\n* Before using Appdome\u2019s AI Agent Team, ensure you meet the following requirements:\n* Appdome account ([create a free Appdome account here](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for Appdome Agentic AI\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see [Signing Secure Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [Signing Secure iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n### [Coding Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/coding_card-1.png)\u00a0Build Agent\n\nAppdome\u2019s Build Agent allows mobile teams select, configure, and build 400+ security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, and compliance protections directly into their Android and iOS apps. It analyzes the app\u2019s architecture, frameworks, and components to automatically compile the correct defenses\u2014no code and no SDK required. The Build Agent streamlines secure app delivery by ensuring every build is correctly protected, certified, and ready for release.\n\n[![Build Agent 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Build_Agent_2.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Build_Agent_2.png)\n\n**Build**  \nThe Build Agent can initiate protection builds via Appdome\u2019s CI/CD plugin, Dev-API, or the Appdome UI. It uses a modular, plug-in framework to automatically code and compile defenses into each app, matching the app\u2019s unique architecture and components. This removes the need for manual coding and ensures consistent, correct implementation each time.  \n**Certify**  \nAs part of the build workflow, the Build Agent automatically validates all applied defenses and generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate for each release. This provides an auditable, build-by-build record of compliance and accelerates DevSecOps approval for every mobile app update.  \n**Comply**  \nThe Build Agent operates inside Appdome\u2019s enterprise-grade compliance system, tracking every build, change, API call, and access action. This gives organizations full visibility and audit control over the complete mobile app defense lifecycle. It ensures governance, transparency, and consistency across teams, pipelines, and app portfolios.\n\n### [Remendiation Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/remendiation_card-1.png)\u00a0AI Support Agent\n\nAppdome\u2019s Support Agent uses Agentic AI to identify on-device mobile threats and guide users through precise, real-time removal steps. It interprets each attack\u2019s ThreatCode\u2122 to tailor instructions to the user\u2019s device, OS version, and specific threat scenario-eliminating manual discovery or investigation. Users and support teams can interact with the agent, ask questions, challenge instructions, and receive updated guidance instantly. This brings fast, contextual, end-user remediation to mobile brands, reducing fear, fraud, and support overhead.\n\n[![Support Agent](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Support_Agent-2.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Support_Agent-2.png)\n\n**Rapid Threat Identification**  \nExplains the threat and its impact immediately using the ThreatCode\u2122 for accurate context. Ensures users understand what the threat is and why it matters.  \n**Detailed Threat Discovery**  \nGuides users to find the threat with simple, device- and OS-specific steps. Reduces guesswork and speeds up detection.  \n**Precise Threat Removal**  \nProvides clear, tailored steps to eliminate the threat and adjusts instructions if something doesn\u2019t work. Ensures complete resolution without external research.  \n**Collaborative Remediation Workflow**  \nLets users and teams ask, challenge, and refine instructions in real time. Supports sharing and collaboration inside Appdome for complex cases.  \n**Enterprise-Grade Guardrails**  \nRuns entirely inside Appdome\u2019s secure platform with no data sent to public AI models. Uses no PII and enforces full audit and access controls for safe deployment.\n\n### [Secops Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/secops_card-1.png)\u00a0SecOps Agent\n\nAppdome\u2019s SecOps Agent autonomously analyzes each brand\u2019s mobile attack surface and delivers clear, actionable insights in real time. It learns continuously from massive threat data streams and correlates attacks with each app\u2019s defense posture to surface severity, impact, and risk. The agent also identifies trends on its own, sends instant alerts, and allows teams to explore any finding through a natural-language interface. This gives cyber, fraud, and risk teams fast, interactive intelligence to understand threats and decide on next steps.\n\n[![Secopsagent Screen](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SecOpsAgent_Screen.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SecOpsAgent_Screen.png)\n\n#### Report Types\n\n**Monthly Account Report**  \nProvides a consolidated view of threat activity across all apps in the account, highlighting the most significant attacks and trends. Correlates threats with defense posture to show what was monitored, mitigated, or blocked. Ideal for high-level, business-focused visibility.  \n**Bi-Weekly App-Specific Threat Category Reports**  \nBreaks down threats per app by category, surfacing detailed patterns, anomalies, and evolving attack techniques. Links findings to app-level defenses to show exposures and blocked threats. Designed for continuous, app-specific monitoring.  \n**On-Demand & Autonomous Reporting**  \nGenerates reports instantly for any app, threat category, or timeframe. Automatically produces alerts and insights when new patterns or emerging attacks are detected. All reports are interactive and support follow-up questions through the agent.\n\n### [Dpm Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dpm_card-1.png)DPM Agent (Defense Posture Management) \u2013 Coming Soon\n\nThe DPM Agent is designed to analyze and evaluate a mobile brand\u2019s overall defense posture using Appdome\u2019s unified data, build history, and threat signals. It uses Agentic AI models to understand how defenses are configured across apps, releases, and environments, and prompts teams when gaps, changes, or notable trends appear. As part of the AI suite, it collaborates with stakeholders to improve visibility and decision-making around which defenses to deploy and how to strengthen the mobile security posture.\n\n### [Devops Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/devops_card-1.png)\u00a0DevOps Agent \u2013 Coming Soon\n\nThe DevOps Agent applies Agentic AI to the mobile app build and deployment process, using Appdome\u2019s decade of defense and build data to guide DevOps teams on configuration, implementation, and release readiness. It acts autonomously to analyze relevant mobile and threat data, prompting teams when new discoveries or optimizations are needed. By integrating into digital workflows, it helps DevOps scale securely and reduce manual work across the build lifecycle.\n\n### [Research Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/research_card-1.png)\u00a0Research Agent \u2013 Coming Soon\n\nThe Research Agent leverages Appdome\u2019s global threat telemetry,trillions of live events-to investigate, correlate, and reason about emerging mobile attacks.

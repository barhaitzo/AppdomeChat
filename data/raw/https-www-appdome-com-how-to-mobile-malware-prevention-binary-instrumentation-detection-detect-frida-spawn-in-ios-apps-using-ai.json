This method grants full access to modify or observe the app\u2019s behavior at runtime, enabling attackers to bypass security controls, inject malicious scripts, disable authentication mechanisms, and extract sensitive data before the app fully loads. Frida Spawn is often used to evade runtime security protections by manipulating the application before it establishes defenses. This technique poses a significant threat to banking, fintech, enterprise, and secure messaging apps, making real-time detection and blocking critical to preventing unauthorized process manipulation.\n\n## How Appdome Protects iOS Apps from Frida Spawn Attacks\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic **Detect Frida Spawn** plugin detects and blocks any attempts to spawn processes using Frida. Spawning processes is a technique used by attackers to initialize Frida\u2019s capabilities and gain control over an application before it fully loads, making it a powerful method for manipulating application behavior at runtime. Appdome\u2019s plugin works by:\n\n* Detecting Frida Spawn Attempts: Monitors the application\u2019s startup sequence to identify if Frida-based tools are attempting to spawn processes related to the app.\n* Blocking Unauthorized Spawns: Stops any unauthorized or suspicious processes initiated via Frida Spawn to ensure the application runs securely.\n* Ensuring Application Integrity: Protects the app from being tampered with during its initialization phase.\n\n### **Why It\u2019s Important**\n\n* Prevents Process Hijacking: Blocks attackers from gaining control over the application through Frida\u2019s spawning capabilities.\n* Maintains Application Security: Ensures that the app starts and operates in a secure and trusted environment without interference.\n* Protects Sensitive Operations: Stops unauthorized access to critical app functionalities or data during its startup phase.\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Strengthened protection against advanced runtime manipulation techniques.\n* Secures the application\u2019s startup sequence and early-stage processes.\n* Mitigates risks associated with unauthorized process control or tampering.\n\nThis feature is a critical security layer for applications requiring robust protection against runtime manipulation, ensuring that attackers cannot interfere with or compromise the app\u2019s behavior.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Appdome's Detect Frida Spawn Plugins:\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s mobile app security build system to  **Detect Frida Spawn** , you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **Detect Frida Spawn**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS)\n* Signing Credentials (see [**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n## How to Implement Detect Frida Spawn in iOS Apps Using Appdome\n\nOn Appdome, follow these **3 simple steps** to create self-defending iOS Apps that **Detect Frida Spawn** without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1. ### [**Designate**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) the Mobile App to be protected.\n\n   1. #### Upload an app via the Appdome Mobile Defense platform GUI or via Appdome\u2019s DEV-API or CI/CD Plugins.\n   2. **iOS Formats:** .ipa\n   3. **Detect Frida Spawn is compatible with:**\n      Obj-C, Java, Swift, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, Cordova and other iOS apps.\n2. ### Select the defense: **Detect Frida Spawn**.****\n\n   1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the Detect Frida Spawn feature as shown below:\n\n      ![fusion set that contains Detect Frida Spawn](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/ios_fs_image.png)\n\n      Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Detect Frida Spawn feature\n\n      1. Follow the steps in Sections [2.2-2.2.2](#2.2) of this article to add the Detect Frida Spawn feature to your Fusion Set via the Appdome Console.\n      2. When you enable Anti Frida Detection Bypass you'll notice that the Fusion Set you created in step 2.1 now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Detect Frida Spawn.\n\n         ![Fusion Set applied Detect Frida Spawn](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iOS_Applied_FS_Detect_Frida_Spawn.png)\n\n         Figure 2: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Detect Frida Spawn protection\n           \n         Note: Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n      3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c...\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set. Copy\n         the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):\n         ![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/copy_fs_id.png)\n\n         Figure 3: Fusion Set Detail Summary\n      4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI or other system:\n         1. Refer to the [Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link) for API building instructions.\n         2. Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python).\n   2. #### Add the **Detect Frida Spawn** feature to your security template.\n\n      1.

We strongly recommend that you test with real Android devices whenever possible. While we discourage testing on emulators for security reasons, as developers ourselves, we certainly understand that it may be desirable or necessary at times to test on emulators. Continue reading to understand how to test secured Android apps using a trusted ARM emulator. We recommend that you only use the ARM emulator when you cannot use an Android device to test with.\u00a0\n\nWe hope you find it useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Test Secured Android Apps Using a Trusted ARM Emulator\n\nAppdome-secured apps are fully capable of being tested using standard ARM-based emulators.\u00a0 If you have a secured Android app and you want to test that app, feel free to use these emulators. x86 simulators and x86 simulators with translations libraries to ARM **are not supported** for security reasons.\n\nApp testing is critical throughout the app development lifecycle. Testing a Fused app is no different.\u00a0 In fact, we have an entire article dedicated on [How to Download Secured Mobile Apps From Appdome.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/download-secured-mobile-apps/)\u00a0Testing apps becomes particularly challenging when there are a large number of device types and versions to test against \u2013 such as in the case of Android-based devices.\u00a0Because of the multiple variables associated with Android, many developers opt to use emulators for testing instead of attempting to have \u201cone of everything.\u201d\n\n**Note:**\u00a0ARM emulators work very slowly on x86 PC machines. So, it might not be producing the best user experience in your testing with Android apps. We recommend you test with physical Android devices.\n\n### Prerequisites for testing Fused App with an Emulator\n\n* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)\n* Fused app\n\n## Easy Steps to Test Secured Android Apps Using a Trusted ARM Emulator\n\n1.

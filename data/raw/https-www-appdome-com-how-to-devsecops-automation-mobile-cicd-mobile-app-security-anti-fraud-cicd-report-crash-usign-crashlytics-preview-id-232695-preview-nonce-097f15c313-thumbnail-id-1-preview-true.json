It captures detailed crash data, including stack traces, logs, and device context, enabling developers to pinpoint the exact source of a crash. By grouping similar crashes together, Crashlytics streamlines debugging and prioritization. Developers can add custom logs and keys to gain deeper insight into user actions and app state at the time of the crash. Integrated alerts and dashboards provide immediate visibility into issues, helping teams act quickly and efficiently. With support for tools like Slack and Jira, Crashlytics fits into modern development workflows and ensures that problems are detected and addressed before they impact a wider user base. Its ease of use and powerful analytics make it an essential part of maintaining high app quality, reducing churn, and delivering a smooth, reliable user experience.\n\n## How Appdome Works With Crashlytics\n\nFor apps secured or enhanced with Appdome, Crashlytics provides important details\u2014like stack traces, device and OS info, and build IDs\u2014that make it easier to understand and resolve issues. Sharing this information helps Appdome support quickly investigate and fix problems. This article shows how to use Crashlytics to gather the key details needed for Appdome to resolve a reported issue.\n\n### 1.

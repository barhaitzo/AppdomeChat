Not all MAM and EMM SDKs are built the same. And, the multitude of mobile apps organizations want to use inside EMM and MAM likewise contain different methods, features, and protocols, some of which conflict with EMM and MAM SDKs. This Knowledge Base article describes how to use the Appdome Mobility Suite to guarantee Android and iOS compatibility with UEM MAM implementations, enabling them to reach more mobile apps. The goal of this knowledge base is to help you make EMM and MAM implementations more agile and flexible, bridge gaps, and extend the broadest EMM and MAM functionality to more apps and use cases.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Guarantee Android and iOS Compatibility with UEM MAM\n\nAppdome is a mobile integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that allows users to add a wide variety of features,\u00a0SDKs & APIs to Android and iOS apps. Using a simple \u2018click to add\u2019 user interface, Appdome allows anyone to easily integrate any EMM or MAM SDK to any mobile app \u2013 instantly, no code or coding required.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement. Likewise, there are no changes required inside the app. Appdome is compatible with mobile apps built in any development environment including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps and non-native apps built in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic and more.\u00a0The Appdome technology adds any EMM and MAM SDK, as well as the relevant standards, frameworks, extensions and more to the app automatically. No manual development work is required.\u00a0Using Appdome, mobile apps will include the EMM or MAM SDK and all the Appdome Mobility Suite features as if everything was natively coded to the app.\n\nThe\u00a0Appdome Mobility Suite is perfect for organizations that need or want to achieve a unified enterprise mobility experience for all users and all apps. Organizations often need to\u00a0complement and extend EMM and MAM SDK to reach apps not supported by EMM vendors, adjust container policies, create Intelligent VPN Tunneling, extend Root/Jailbreak protection and more. In addition, organizations often need a greater range of mobile permission controls to customize the mobility experience for their users, ensure compliance and segregate work and personal use-cases on BYOD devices.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome Mobility Suite\n\nIn order to use all of the features in Appdome Mobility Suite you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) \u2013 Android (.apk or .aab) or iOS (.ipa)\n* An EMM environment:\n  + [Intune](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/publish-secure-enterprise-apps-built-intune-sdk/)\n  + [MaaS](https://www.appdome.com/contact-us/ibm-maas360/)\n  + [VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-vmware-workspace-one/publish-enterprise-apps-built-workspace-one/)\n  + [MobileIron](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/use-appdome-to-integrate-a-mobile-app-with-the-mobilelron-appconnect-sdk/)\n  + BlackBerry \u2013 [UEM](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/publish-secure-enterprise-apps-built-blackberry-sdk/) or [GC](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/deploying-apps-fused-with-the-blackberry-dynamics-emm-sdk-through-good-control/)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## The Easy Steps to Guarantee Android and iOS Compatibility with UEM MAM\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to use Appdome Mobility Suite to customize and extend EMM and MAM SDK implementations:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to [add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n### From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Select Appdome Mobility Suite Features\n\nSelect the **Build Tab**. *Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active.*\n\nBeneath the Build Tab, select **Management**.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n\n1.

Mobile Permission Controls are above and beyond the policies and restrictions available via the EMM or MAM SDK. Examples of new mobile permission controls include:\n  + *Prohibit Local Contacts* \u2013 Prevents users from importing local contacts to the app\n  + *Prohibit Local Calendar*\u00a0\u2013 Prevents importing local calendar to the app\n  + *In-App Calls Only* \u2013 Ensures all calls are made using the apps native dialer when applicable. This prevents the app from displaying alternate phone apps when a phone number is clicked within the app.\n  + *In-App Messages Only* \u2013 This option ensures all message are made using the app\u2019s native messaging service, when applicable. This prevents the app from displaying alternate messaging apps when a contact is clicked within the app.\n  + *Prohibit Camera* \u2013 Block App requests to access the camera.\n  + *Prohibit Microphone* \u2013 Block App requests to access the camera.\n  + *Prohibit Location* \u2013 Block App requests to access the GPS location.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/control2.png)\n\n### Click \u201cBuild My App\u201d\n\nThe technology behind build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to integrate the EMM or MAM SDK and the various Appdome Mobility Suite features to the mobile app in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0When your implementation is complete, you\u2019ll receive the notice below. You now have a mobile app fully integrated with your EMM or MAM SDK of choice plus the Appdome Mobility Suite features.\n\n![success message for no code EMM SDK Implementation on appdome ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Success-650x352.png)\n\n## What to do After I build My App?\n\nAfter you successfully built an app, you need to sign the app in order to deploy it. You can also brand or customize a built app on Appdome.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-built App\n\nAppdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this\u00a0[knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps )\n\nIf you\u2019d like to add private server certificates, CAs, and/or server public certificate files you can add these here under\u00a0**Private Server Certificates and Authorities**in\u00a0**App Set-Up**.\n\n### Sign the Appdome-built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-built app, it must be signed.\u00a0[Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\u00a0and signing[Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/)\u00a0are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use\u00a0[Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the\u00a0Appdome-built App\u00a0to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice.\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy your Appdome built app!\n\n### **How Do I Learn More?**\n\nCheck out Appdome Mobility Suite for enterprise\u00a0[blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/appdome-mobility-suite-enterprise-mobility-strategy/)\u00a0or [request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/) at any time.\u00a0\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com)!

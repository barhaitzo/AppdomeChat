With iOS 18, SharePlay\u2019s capabilities expanded to include options for users to draw on another\u2019s screen or control devices remotely during calls. These advanced functionalities, while enhancing user interaction, introduce new security vulnerabilities that need addressing, especially for apps handling sensitive data.\n\n## **How Does Appdome Protect Mobile iOS Apps from SharePlay Attacks?**\n\nAppdome tackles the security risks associated with SharePlay through advanced security \u2018[Prevent Screensharing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/anti-spyware-android-ios/protect-ios-apps-from-screen-sharing-malware/)\u2018 and \u2018[Block Remote Desktop Control](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/social-engineering-prevention/block-team-viewer-remote-desktop-exploits-in-ios-apps/)\u2018 features.\n\nThe \u2018Prevent Screensharing\u2019 feature ensures that sensitive content within an app cannot be broadcast via SharePlay or any other screen-sharing outlet. This protection is crucial for apps handling sensitive personal or business information.\n\nOn the other hand, the \u2018Block Remote Desktop Control\u2019 feature safeguards against remote manipulation attempts, ensuring that no external party can control the app\u2019s functions remotely. Together, these protections fortify iOS apps against unauthorized access and control, maintaining the integrity and security of the user\u2019s data during SharePlay sessions.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Block Remote Desktop Exploits in iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/social-engineering-prevention/block-team-viewer-remote-desktop-exploits-in-ios-apps/)\n* [How to Protect iOS Apps from Screen Sharing Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/anti-spyware-android-ios/protect-ios-apps-from-screen-sharing-malware/)\n* [How to Protect Android & iOS Apps from Copy/Paste Attacks](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/anti-spyware-android-ios/protect-android-ios-apps-from-copypaste-attacks/)\n\n### **Frequently Asked Questions:**\n\n1. **How effective is Appdome\u2019s Prevent App Screen Sharing protection during SharePlay sessions?**\n   * When screen sharing is initiated via SharePlay, Appdome\u2019s feature prevents the other user from controlling the device or clicking buttons. This ensures no unauthorized interaction. and if an attempt is made, the \u201cBlockedScreenCaptureEvent\u201d threat event is triggered, providing robust protection across iOS devices from iOS 15 onwards.\n2. **What occurs when remote device control is enabled over FaceTime with Appdome\u2019s Remote Desktop Control?**\n   * With this feature active, only contacts that have been in the device\u2019s address book for several days and are pre-verified can attempt control. iOS confirms user acknowledgment before access is granted. If an unverified or new contact attempts control, Appdome\u2019s \u201cRemote Desktop Control\u201d security event is triggered, effectively blocking unauthorized access.\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

NTLM uses a challenge-response mechanism for authentication, in which clients are able to prove their identities without sending their password to the server. Mobile Authentication to industry-standard Microsoft Active Directory (AD) using NTLM has always posed challenges as many mobile apps don\u2019t speak NTLM natively.\n\nThis knowledge base article demonstrates how to add NTLM capabilities to any mobile app to authenticate with Microsoft Active Directory without coding or development.\n\n## Adding NTLM to Mobile Apps for Authentication to Microsoft AD\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features and 3rd party services like Microsoft ADFS to Android and iOS apps without coding. \u00a0This KB shows mobile developers,\u00a0DevSec\u00a0and security professionals how to use\u00a0Appdome\u2019s simple \u2018click to build\u2019 user interface to quickly and easily make mobile apps work with Microsoft authentication.\u00a0\n\nMobile apps usually don\u2019t support webviews at the authentication point and don\u2019t have a mechanism to receive and store external cookies from the AD server. Active Directory and NTLM services also don\u2019t have a framework to share authentication state among apps on a device.\n\nUsing Appdome, authentication to Microsoft AD from Android and iOS apps can be accomplished even if the original app does not support AD, NTLM or Kerberos. With Appdome, developers and enterprises can integrate NTLM to mobile apps providing seamless and true SSO authentication for mobile users.\n\n### Prerequisites for Adding\u00a0 NTLM to Mobile Apps\n\nThere is no prerequisite that the mobile app, or its server, to support SAML, OAuth, OAuth 2.0,\u00a0OpenID Connect or other standards\u00a0prior to using Appdome. For more information on how Appdome gets, retrieves and stores\u00a0Active Directory\u00a0cookies in mobile apps, please review the data sheet on\u00a0[No Code Microsoft Authentication in Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/enterprise-mobile-apps/mobile-iam/microsoft-identity/).\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of Microsoft authentication on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk for Android)\n* AD Hub URL\n* Authentication Successful URI on AD\n* Application protected resource URL\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## A Few Easy Steps to Make Mobile Apps Work with NTLM Authentication\n\nUpload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n1. From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, go to the Authentication tab.\n2. Enable **Authentication Profiles**\n3. Select **Windows Challenge/Response (NTLM)**\n4. If you want to set specific resources that require the SSO authentication, change the \u201c**Protected Resource**\u201d from \u201call\u201d to any URL you want, you can add several addresses.\n5. Add the **Authentication Server** URL.\n6. Add the **Redirect URI.**\n7. Click\u00a0**Build My App**\n\n![how to Make Mobile Apps Work with NTLM Authentication](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation1-9.png)\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integration, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to add Microsoft AD to the mobile app in seconds (instead of requiring mobile developers to manually modify source code to implement the required authentication functionality or framework).\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0You now have a mobile app fully integrated with Microsoft AD/NTLM.\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\n### No Coding Dependency\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\n## How to Sign & Publish\u00a0Secured Mobile Apps Built on\u00a0Appdome\n\nAfter successfully building your app using Appdome, there are several available options to complete your project, depending on\u00a0your\u00a0app lifecycle or workflow.

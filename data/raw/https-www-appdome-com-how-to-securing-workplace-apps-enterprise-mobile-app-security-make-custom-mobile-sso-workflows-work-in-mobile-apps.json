This framework provides flexibility to build Custom Mobile SSO Workflows inside any Android/iOS app, using industry-standard methods to retrieve and pass user details between authentication services and mobile apps.\u00a0 This Knowledge Base article explains how to make custom mobile SSO Workflows work in mobile apps to retrieve and pass user details between authentication services and mobile apps.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Make Custom Mobile SSO Workflows Work in Mobile Apps\n\nAdding Single Sign-On (SSO) to Android and iOS apps involves several significant considerations. Perhaps the most significant consideration is \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d the SSO workflow will take place inside the app. Usually, an SSO workflow is initiated at the start of a login sequence. In this use case, the client and the server are built to handle the basic authentication sequence (User \u2013> launches app \u2013> enters credentials \u2013> credentials verified by the server \u2013> user issued a token or cookie allowing access to the app).\n\nBut, what if the app developer hasn\u2019t built or doesn\u2019t want to build support for basic authentication? Or, what if the app developer wants more than the username and password provided in the basic authentication workflow (e.g., access to user details available in new authentication methods)? In these cases, Appdome-Threat Events provide a framework to pass user details\u00a0contained\u00a0in an\u00a0OpenID and SAML\u00a0authentication\u00a0response\u00a0to the app developer.\u00a0This\u00a0framework allows new flexibility to create custom SSO workflows inside an app using industry-standard methods to retrieve and pass user details between authentication services and mobile apps.\u00a0\n\nMany organizations\u00a0use Identity Providers (IdPs)\u00a0like\u00a0Azure AD, Okta, Ping, etc. These authentication services usually connect on the backend\u00a0to a store of user data and use SAML or OpenID to handle authentication requests. Using SAML and OpenID, applications have access to all the user and authentication details returned by the server backend (i.e. any data the backend implements).\n\nThis article will demonstrate how Appdome can pass these user details to an app at any point in the application logic, at launch, or otherwise.\u00a0\n\n### Prerequisites for Building Custom Mobile SSO Workflows Inside Android and iOS Apps\n\nIn order to use Appdome-Threat Events you need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [Appdome-DEV](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\u00a0access\n* Threat Events license\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## The Easy Steps to Make Custom Mobile SSO Workflows Work in Mobile Apps\n\nWith OAuth, OpenID (over OAuth) or Saml, apps can perform standard authentication and authorization flows. When using SSO, Tokens are supplied to the client upon successful authentication/authorization. These tokens contain data components that can be further used to access protected resources and gather user information such as user ID, email address and more.\n\nA detailed description of the information that can be found in these tokens can be found here:\u00a0[Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens), [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#id-token-claims).\n\n### Developer\u2019s Flow:\n\n1. App registers to an Appdome-Threat Event.\n2. Once the application accesses a protected resource, Appdome Mobile SSO will begin the authentication flow as described [here](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-mobile-sso/use-modern-authentication-android-ios-apps/).\n3. When the authentication flow has completed, Appdome sends a notification to the app which contains information extracted from the tokens.\n\n### Event Description:\n\nThe event sent by Appdome will be called \u201cAuthInfoEvent\u201d and will comprise of a dictionary that contains the following fields (all strings):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u201cAuthenticated\u201d | A boolean value (as a string) indicating whether the authentication flow has completed successfully. |\n| \u201cUserName\u201d | User identifier extracted from the idToken token, this could be a username, email or any other unique user identifier. |\n| \u201cAccessToken\u201d | The access token incorporated in the OAuth token that was provided by the authenticating party as a result of successful authentication. This token should be used to access protected resources governed by the authenticating party. |\n| \u201cDecodedAccessToken\u201d | The decoded body of the access token. Includes various data on the user as well as the requested scopes. |\n| \u201cIdToken\u201d | The id\\_token is a JSON Web Token (JWT)\u00a0that contains user profile information (such as the user\u2019s name and email) which is represented in the form of claims. These claims are statements about the user. |\n| \u201cdecodedIdToken\u201d | The decoded form of the id\\_token, this will hold all the claims correlating to the user\u2019s authentication request. Content may vary between different authenticating parties. |\n| \u201cSamlRequest\u201d | the SSO request sent to the\u00a0identity provider. |\n| \u201cDecodedSamlRequest\u201d | the inflated and decoded SAML request. |\n| \u201cSamlResponse\u201d | the SSO response that contains the assertions. |\n| \u201cDecodedSamlResponse\u201d | the decoded SAML response. |\n\nIn case of an error, another event, denoted by \u201cAuthErrorEvent\u201d, will be sent with the following fields (all strings):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u201cDeveventDetailedErrorMessage\u201d | If an error occurred this will hold the error description. |\n| \u201cRESOURCE\\_URL\u201d | the URL that was to trigger an authentication process, but failed. |\n\n### How To Add Custom Single Sign-On Workflows to Your App\n\nIn order for an app to receive the information above, the app will need to listen for notifications on the event and set a callback routine that will handle the data received in the event.\u00a0 The code snippets below will register the app to receive a notification when authentication is complete and sets a callback routine that will extract all the keys above from the event data.\n\nTo receive an Appdome-Threat Event on iOS:\n\n```\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName: @\"AuthInfoEvent\" object:nil queue:[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {\r\n    NSLog(@\"Received Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 AuthInfoEvent event with value: %@\", [note userInfo]);\r\n    \r\n    NSString *authenticated = [note userInfo][@\"Authenticated\"];\r\n    NSString *userName = [note userInfo][@\"UserName\"];\r\n    NSString *accessToken = [note userInfo][@\"AccessToken\"];\r\n    NSString *decodedAccessToken = [note userInfo][@\"DecodedAccessToken\"];\r\n    NSString *idToken = [note userInfo][@\"IdToken\"];\r\n    NSString *decodedIdToken = [note userInfo][@\"DecodedIdToken\"];\r\n    NSString *samlRequest = [note userInfo][@\"SamlRequest\"];\r\n    NSString *decodedSamlRequest = [note userInfo][@\"DecodedSamlRequest\"];\r\n    NSString *samlResponse = [note userInfo][@\"SamlResponse\"];\r\n    NSString *decodedSamlResponse = [note userInfo][@\"DecodedSamlResponse\"];\r\n}];\r\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName: @\"AuthErrorEvent\" object:nil queue:[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {\r\n    NSLog(@\"Received Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 AuthErrorEvent event with value: %@\", [note userInfo]);\r\n    \r\n    NSString *resourceUrl = [note userInfo][@\"RESOURCE_URL\"];\r\n    NSString *error = [note userInfo][@\"DeveventDetailedErrorMessage\"];\r\n}];\n```\n\nTo receive an event on Android, simply create a BroadcastReciever and register it for events you need to receive:\n\n```\nBroadcastReceiver eventsReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {\r\n    private static final String TAG = \"AuthEventRcvr\";\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {\r\n        Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();\r\n        String event = intent.getAction();\r\n\r\n        if (event.compareTo(\"AuthErrorEvent\") == 0) {\r\n            Log.i(TAG, \"found AuthErrorEvent: \" + extras.toString());\r\n            String resourceUrl = extras.getString(\"RESOURCE_URL\");\r\n            String error = extras.getString(\"DeveventDetailedErrorMessage\");\r\n        }\r\n        if (event.compareTo(\"AuthInfoEvent\") == 0) {\r\n            Log.i(TAG, \"found AuthInfoEvent: \" + extras.toString());\r\n            String authenticated = extras.getString(\"Authenticated\");\r\n            String userName = extras.getString(\"UserName\");\r\n            String accessToken = extras.getString(\"AccessToken\");\r\n            String decodedAccessToken = extras.getString(\"DecodedAccessToken\");\r\n            String idToken = extras.getString(\"IdToken\");\r\n            String decodedIdToken = extras.getString(\"DecodedIdToken\");\r\n            String samlRequest = extras.getString(\"SamlRequest\");\r\n            String decodedSamlRequest = extras.getString(\"DecodedSamlRequest\");\r\n            String samlResponse = extras.getString(\"SamlResponse\");\r\n            String decodedSamlResponse = extras.getString(\"DecodedSamlResponse\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nprivate void registerReceiver(Context context) {\r\n    IntentFilter intentFilter = new IntentFilter();\r\n    intentFilter.addAction(\"AuthInfoEvent\");\r\n    intentFilter.addAction(\"AuthErrorEvent\");\r\n\r\n    context.registerReceiver(eventsReceiver, intentFilter);\r\n    or\r\n    LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(context).registerReceiver(eventsReceiver, intentFilter);\r\n}\n```\n\n### How To Trigger Single Sign-On In Your App using Appdome-Threat Events\n\nTo trigger an Appdome to start an SSO flow on iOS, you can send an Appdome-Threat Event like so:\n\n```\nNSString *resourceUrl = @\"https://my_resource/path\";\r\nNSLog(@\"sending Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 StartSSOFlow with url [%@]\", resourceUrl);\r\nNSMutableDictionary *eventInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];\r\neventInfo[@\"RESOURCE_URL\"] = resourceUrl;\r\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName: @\"StartSSOFlow\" object:nil userInfo:eventInfo];\n```\n\nTo trigger an Appdome to start an SSO flow on Android, you can send an Appdome-Threat Event like so:\n\n```\nString resourceUrl = \"https://my_resource/path\";\r\nLog.i(TAG, \"sending Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 StartSSOFlow with url \" + resourceUrl);\r\nBundle data = new Bundle();\r\ndata.putString(\"RESOURCE_URL\", resourceUrl);\r\nIntent intent = new Intent(\"StartSSOFlow\");\r\nintent.putExtras(data);\r\n\r\nsendBroadcast(intent);\r\nor\r\nLocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).sendBroadcast(intent);\n```\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you

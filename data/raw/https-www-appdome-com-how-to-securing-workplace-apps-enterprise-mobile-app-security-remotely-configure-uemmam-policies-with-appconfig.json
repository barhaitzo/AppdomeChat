Adding Custom EMM Policies in AppConfig lets you control and manage the app, apply custom EMM policies including DLP and tunnel policies and populate settings required by your app using App Configuration policies from the EMM Management Console (UEM) for BYOD or managed devices.\n\n## How to Remotely Configure UEM/MAM Policies with AppConfig\n\nUse the Appdome Mobility Suite to remotely configure EUM/MAM policies with AppConfig.\n\n### Prerequisites for Remotely Configuring UEM/MAM Policies with AppConfig\n\nHere\u2019s what you need\n\n* Appdome account (If you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[create a free Appdome account here)](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Remotely Configure UEM/MAM Policies with AppConfig\n\nPlease\u00a0follow these 3 easy steps to remotely configure UEM/MAM policies with AppConfig\n\n1. [**Upload**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0an Android or iOS App to Appdome\u2019s no code security platform (.apk, .aab, or .ipa)\n2. In the Build Tab, under Management and EMM Services, Select the **ONE AppConfig from Appdome** option\n3. Follow the steps below and Click\u00a0**Build My App**\n\n#### Appdome Mobility Suite Features\n\nThe Appdome Mobility Suite organizes the options to customize and extend EMM and MAM SDK implementations into easy to find sections. These capabilities would ordinarily need to be developed and coded into an app. With Appdome, adding these capabilities to mobile apps is completed in seconds.\n\n* [*Dynamic Container Management\u2122*](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/improve-performance-uem-mam-encryption-container/)\u00a0\u2013 This is an EMM or MAM container optimization feature that ensures mobile app performance is not impacted by EMM and MAM SDKs. This feature leverages Appdome\u2019s proprietary Dynamic Container Management methods and provides users with an easy way to configure TOTALDataTM Encryption, Folder Management, and Nested Filesystems.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Presentation1-5.png)\n\n* *EMM Tunneling*\u00a0\u2013 Appdome Mobility Suite allows organizations to control and customize the EMM VPN or Tunnel used inside the mobile apps by telling Appdome how to implement the EMM or MAM SDK.\n  + [Adaptive App Routing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/get-mobile-apps-work-eum-mdm-vpn-tunnel/)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Select the Routing Schemes to use with your app, including support for VoIP, exclusions, whitelist URLs and other settings.\n  + Appdome PreAuth and\u00a0[EMM Authenticated Tunnel](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/add-blackberry-good-authenticated-tunnel-to-any-mobile-app-fast/)\u00a0\u2013 Apply EMM authentication (via EMM supported methods such as Kerberos, KCD and Certificates) to mobile apps and use EMM authentication schemes for tunneled traffic. e.\n\n![how to add Custom EMM policies in AppConfig](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-10-22-at-11.39.43-650x158.png)\n\n* *Custom EMM Policies and Populate Settings in AppConfig*\u2013 With these options enabled you can populate your Fused app\u2019s preferences\u00a0using an EMM configuration payload.\u00a0 Custom EMM Policies allow you to apply AppConfig settings to an app on managed or BYOD devices.\u00a0 It will convert the settings from an EMM for the configuration settings to AppConfig format that the app can read.For iOS application \u2013 The JSON file defined in BlackBerry Server configuration payload will be populated directly into the app Standard User Defaults (NSUserDefaults).  \n  For Android application \u2013 The JSON file defined in BlackBerry Server configuration payload will be populated directly into the app DeafultSharedPrefernces using PreferenceManager.  \n  ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Presentation8.png)\n\n* [BoostEMMTM](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/boostemm-by-appdome/)\u2013 Once you select the BlackBerry EMM SDK, open BoostEMM\u2122 to ensure additional features are added to your app including:\n  + [*Connect Secure Browser*](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/connecting-secure-browsers-to-mobile-apps/)\u00a0\u2013 When enabled, this feature ensures web links opened in the app, will be opened using the EMMs secure web browser app.\n  + [*Connect Secure Email*](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/connecting-secure-email-to-mobile-apps/)\u00a0\u2013 When enabled, this feature ensures email links opened in the app, will be opened using the EMMs secure email client app.\n  + [*Secure Document Sharing*](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/share-encrypted-documents-between-mobile-apps/)\u00a0\u2013 When enabled, this feature blocks opening files in third-party apps.\u00a0 This will also disable all other document sharing.\n  + *In-App BlackBerry Analytics \u2013*This allows the app you are building to use BlackBerry Analytics events in the app.\n  + *Report BlackBerry Events*\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Automatically report BlackBerry Dynamics events such as activation, authentication and policy updates to BB Analytics.\n\n### Click \u201cBuild My App\u201d\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0When your implementation is complete, you\u2019ll receive the notice below. You now have a mobile app fully integrated with the BlackBerry SDK plus the Appdome Mobility Suite features.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Success.png)\n\n## What to do After I Build My App?\n\nAfter you\u2019ve successfully Fused an app, you need to sign the app in order to deploy it. You can also brand or customize a Fused app on Appdome.\n\nHere is a link to an [article with more information on completing mobile integration on Fused apps](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-complete-your-mobile-app-integration-project-after-integrating-your-mobile-app-on-appdome/).\n\n## Adding Integrated SAP Jam app to BlackBerry for Deployment to Mobile Devices\n\nOnce you have used Appdome to integrate the SAP Jam app to the BlackBerry Dynamics EMM SDK, you can add the app to the BlackBerry Management Console (UEM) as a BlackBerry Entitlements app.\n\n1.

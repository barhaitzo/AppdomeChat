No code or SDKs are required.\n\nThe purpose of Appdome\u2019s Build-2Secure step for Bitrise is to streamline and accelerate cyber and anti-fraud delivery in CI/CD pipelines. To do this, the Build-2Secure step for Bitrise automates three essential steps in delivering more secure mobile applications to your users quickly:\n\n(1) Building app-level protections into mobile apps.\n\n(2) Code-signing the protected mobile app.\n\n(3) Certifying the security of each protected mobile app.\n\nBy using the Appdome Build-2Secure step for Bitrise, you can quickly deliver [**Certified Secure**](https://www.appdome.com/certified-secure-mobile-devsecops-certification/)\u2122 mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile anti-bot, and other cyber defense updates to mobile apps on the [Appdome Cyber Defense Automation Platform](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-cicd-system/). This step can be used as a stand-alone DevSecOps integration or in combination with other DevSecOps integrations in your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nFor more general information on Bitrise Workflow Steps, visit the Bitrise website and navigate to [Managing Tools](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/references/bitrise-tools.html \"https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/references/bitrise-tools.html\").\u00a0\n\n## Prerequisites to use Appdome\u2019s Build-2Secure Step for Bitrise\n\nBefore you begin using Appdome with Bitrise, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* An [Appdome SRM account](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-release-management/) [**(create an Appdome account here)**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)\n* [Appdome API token](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-and-resetting-your-api-token)\n* [Fusion Set\u2019s ID](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-a-fusion-sets-id)\n* A [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io/) account\n\n## Step 1: Getting Started with Build-2Secure Step for Bitrise\n\nThe Appdome Build-2Secure step takes an unprotected application file (apk, aab, or ipa), rebuilds the file, and signs it using the On-Appdome platform, based on the selected fusion set and signature method. This step can be performed either as part of an existing workflow or as a new workflow, where you must provide the application file as part of the input.\n\nWhen adding Appdome\u2019s Build-2Secure step to an existing workflow, it must be added in the correct position: after the **build** step has generated a valid app (apk/aab/ipa) file and before the build artifact has been signed and deployed.\n\n## **Step 2: Creating a New Workflow for the Build-2Secure Step in Bitrise**\n\nIf you\u2019re adding Build-2Secure to an **existing workflow**, skip this section and proceed to Step 3.\n\nTo create a new workflow:\n\n**To create a workflow with****Appdome Build-2Secure**:\n\n1. Log in to [Bitrise](https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard) and select your app from the Projects list.  \n   **Note:** If your app is not on the list, follow the [Bitrise process to add an app.](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/getting-started/adding-your-first-app.html)\n\n   ![1. Select Your Project](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1.-Select-your-project.png)\n2. Click the **Workflows** button at the top right to open the Workflow Editor.  \n   ![2. Click Workflows](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2.-Click-Workflows.png)\n3. Click **+ Create Workflow.**  \n   ![+createworkflow](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CreateWorkflow.png)\n4. Enter your workflow name and click **Create Workflow**.  \n   ![3. Create Workflow](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3.-Create-Workflow-626x366.png)\n5. Click the **+** icon directly under your workflow name in the workflow editor (as shown in the image below).\n6. This will display a list of available steps. Search for **Appdome Build-2Secure** and select it.  \n   ![Add Step](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Add-Step-.png)\n7. Enter the following Build-2Secure Step Parameters:\n   * **App file URL** (mandatory)The location of the app file (apk/aab/ipa) is to be built and signed by On-Appdome. This field can be a URL address of an external location or an environment variable indicating the file location.  \n     **Note**: You can define your environment variables under the **Env Vars** tab. If you are using the Appdome Build-2Secure step as part of an existing workflow, this field should be populated with the output of the previous step; for example, $BITRISE\\_APK\\_PATH, $BITRISE\\_AAB\\_PATH, and $BITRISE\\_IPA\\_PATH.\n   * **Optional: Output file name**  \n     If you want the build output files to be automatically placed in the artifacts section, add the \u201cDeploy to Bitrise.io \u2013 Build Artifacts, Test Reports, and Pipeline intermediate files\u201d step by selecting it from the steps library.\n   * **Fusion Set ID** (mandatory)  \n     Appdome fusion set ID. Ensure that this ID is valid for the type of project you are using (Android/iOS).\n   * **Optional: Team ID**  \n     The team ID on the On-Appdome platform.\n   * **Select Signing Method** (mandatory)  \n     Use the **Signing Method** field to select the appropriate method for signing your app. Each signing method requires additional parameters, as detailed below.\n   * **Secondary Output (Android only)**Set to **true** if your app type is .aab and you require a secondary output in the form of a secured universal apk file. The output file will consistently be named \u201cAppdome\\_Universal.apk\u201d and will be represented by the $APPDOME\\_SECURED\\_SO\\_PATH environment variable. This option applies only to Android-type builds with .aab app types when using On-Appdome or Private Signing methods.\n   * **Build With Diagnostic Logs**Set to **true** if you want to build with diagnostics logs.\n   * **Build to test Vendor**Some protected builds cannot run or be tested on real device clouds due to the nature of the vendor\u2019s cloud environment. By selecting a device cloud vendor, the build will be suitable for testing on the selected vendor. You will not be able to run this build on other vendors or an end-user device. For production or general-purpose builds, choose **None**.  \n     **Note:** Use this option only for testing purposes on one of the selectable cloud vendors. For other purposes, select **None**.  \n     ![Appdome Build2secure Workflow](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Appdome_Build2Secure-workflow.png)\n8. **Name Your Workflow Logs File:**\n   * When setting up your workflow on the Bitrise platform, you can assign a specific name to your Appdome workflow output log file. This name will help you identify your logs easily.  \n     ![Screenshot 2024 11 05 At 13.17.28](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2024-11-05-at-13.17.28-e1730806677527.png)\n9. Navigate to the Build Tab in your Bitrise dashboard to view the logs associated with your workflows.\n   * Under the \u2018Build log\u2019 tab, you will see detailed logs of your workflow. This includes any logs that are specifically generated by the Appdome integration.\n   * To access the Appdome workflow logs file you named earlier, click on the \u2018Artifacts\u2019 tab within the same build page. The log file will be available for download or review here.\n10. Continue adding the relevant steps to your workflow.\n\n## **Step 3: Configuring Code Signing for Android and iOS Apps**\n\n### Google Play Signing (Android only):\n\nIf your app will be uploaded to Google Play, you\u2019ll need to configure **Google Signing**:\n\n1. Go to the **Google Signing** section.\n2. Set the **Google Play Signing** toggle to **true**.\n3. Define a Key named **GOOGLE\\_PLAY**\\_**FINGERPRINT.** This key is required if you are building an Android app that will be uploaded to Google Play. This variable should hold your Google Play fingerprint.\n4. Define a Key named **SIGN\\_FINGERPRINT.** If a Google Play signature is not required, then this variable should be holding your signing fingerprint.\n\n### **For an Android app project using the [Private-Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/privately-code-sign-sealed-android-apps-using-devsecops-build-system/)\u00a0/[Auto-Dev-Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/automate-secure-android-app-code-signing-in-devops-cicd/) method.**\n\n1. Google Signing > Google Play Signing (Android only)\n\n   * Set to **true** if Google Play signing is required or **false** if not.\n   * If set to \u2018true,\u2019 a Google Sign Fingerprint must be provided. Click on the Google Signing category to expand it and configure the Google Signing parameters. Additionally, if \u2018true,\u2019 the $SIGN\\_FINGERPRINT is required in the Secrets tab.\n\n### **Android App Project \u2013 Keystore Configuration:**\n\nWhen signing an Android app project using the On-Appdome method, an Android Keystore file must be uploaded by following the steps below:\n\n1. Go to **Project Settings** and click on the **Code Signing** tab.\n2. **Upload your Keystore file.  \n   ![Bitrise Add Keystore File](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitrise-Add-keystore-file-.png)**\n3. Enter the **keystore password**, **keystore alias**, and **private key password** in the respective fields. Bitrise will automatically assign environment variables to these fields. **![Enter Keystore Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Enter-keystore-credentials-.png)**\n4. Click **Continue**. After the file has been uploaded, its name will be displayed under the **Android Keystore File** section.  \n   ****![Keystore Details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Keystore-Details.png)****\n\n### **iOS App Project \u2013 Signing Configuration:**\n\nWhen signing an iOS app project using the On-Appdome method, an iOS **.p12 file** and **provisioning profile** must be uploaded:\n\n**For an iOS app project with an [On-Appdome,](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/use-code-sign-on-mac-for-secured-ios-apps/?__hstc=267077713.3c43294e9307f420a10f7d944c8e169c.1680087852957.1681028836057.1681045200499.4&__hssc=267077713.1.1681045200499&__hsfp=3783124442) [Private-Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/privately-code-sign-sealed-ios-apps-using-devsecops-build-system/?__hstc=267077713.3c43294e9307f420a10f7d944c8e169c.1680087852957.1681028836057.1681045200499.4&__hssc=267077713.1.1681045200499&__hsfp=3783124442)[/](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/use-code-sign-on-mac-for-secured-ios-apps/?__hstc=267077713.3c43294e9307f420a10f7d944c8e169c.1680087852957.1681028836057.1681045200499.4&__hssc=267077713.1.1681045200499&__hsfp=3783124442)[Auto-Dev-Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/automate-secure-ios-app-code-signing-in-devops-cicd/) signing method:**\n\n1. Upload your **.p12 file**. Appdome signing supports only one certificate file, so if you\u2019ve uploaded multiple certificate files, specify which one to use in the **Code Signing Certificates (.p12) file name** field.  \n   ![Add .p12 File](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/add-.p12-file.png)\n2. Enter the **certificate password** and click **Continue**.  \n   ![Continue](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/continue.png)\n3. Review the details and click **Add Certificate**.\n4. Upload the provisioning profile file to the **Provisioning Profile** section.  \n   ![Add Provisioning Profile](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2024-09-11-at-10.43.58-1.png)\n5. Review the details and click **Add Profile**.\n\n**Note**: Bitrise platform supports up to 60 provisioning files. If you have uploaded multiple certificate files, not all of them are required for a specific build. In that case, you will be able to specify which files to use for signing later during the step configuration process.\n\n### Define Environment Variables\n\nSecrets are environmental variables that hold sensitive data. These are securely stored in the Bitrise platform.\n\n1. Click the **Secrets** tab.\n2. Click **Add New**.\n3. Define a Key named **APPDOME\\_API\\_KEY** with the value of your Appdome API token.  \n   ![Secret Environment Variables](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/secret-environment-variables-650x321.png)\n4. Click **Save**.\n\n## Add Entitlements\n\n1. Navigate to Project Settings\n2. Click on the Files tab\n3. Click Add file\n4. Give each entitlement file a unique file storage ID and remember the variable name Bitrise assigned to it.\n5. In this example, the File Storage ID assigned to the entitlements file is **ENTITLEMENTS\\_1**.  \n   ![Add Entitlements](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Add-entitlements.png)\n\n**Note:** In this example, Bitrise has assigned it the variable name **$BITRISEIO\\_ENTITLEMENTS\\_1\\_URL**. This name will be the environment variable referred to in the workflow. You can upload up to five entitlement files (each up to 5MB).\n\n## **Step 5: Run the Workflow \u2013 Build & Sign Android & iOS Security with Build-2Secure**\n\n1. After filling in these parameters, click **Save Changes** to save the workflow.\n2. If you are required to provide a branch name for your build, enter the branch name and click **Run Workflow**.  \n   ![Run Workflow](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Run-Workflow.png)\n\nThe Appdome Build-2secure will automatically listen for the build and sign commands sent from Bitrise and add the mobile app security, anti-fraud, and other protections to your Android or iOS mobile app as specified in the Fusion Set associated with this app.\n\n## **Step 6: Retrieve DevSecOps Certification with Build-2Secure Step**\n\nWhen completed, the following environmental variables will hold the build output:\n\n$APPDOME\\_SECURED\\_APK\\_PATH \u2013 Appdome secured build of a .apk app path.\n\n$APPDOME\\_SECURED\\_AAB\\_PATH \u2013 Appdome secured build of a .aab app path.\n\n$APPDOME\\_SECURED\\_SO\\_PATH \u2013 Appdome secured secondary output of a .aab app (Appdome\\_Universal.apk) path.\n\n$APPDOME\\_SECURED\\_IPA\\_PATH \u2013 Appdome secured build of a .ipa app path.\n\n$APPDOME\\_CERTIFICATE\\_PATH \u2013 Certified Secure Certificate .pdf file path.\n\n$APPDOME\\_PRIVATE\\_SIGN\\_SCRIPT\\_PATH \u2013 Sign .sh script file path\n\n$APPDOME\\_DEOB\\_MAPPING\\_FILES \u2013 Appdome de-obfuscation mapping files .zip file\n\nIf the **Deploy to Bitrise.io\u2014Build Artifacts, Test Reports, and Pipeline intermediate files step was used, the Appdome protected files (or .sh sign script) with the** Appdome\\_ prefix, and the certificate PDF file will be in the Artifacts tab, both ready for download.\n\n**Congratulations!** You can now use your secured mobile app.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps in Jenkins CI/CD Pipelines](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/mobile-appsec-cicd/use-appdome-build-2secure-plugin-for-jenkins/)\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps in GitLab CI/CD Pipelines](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/mobile-appsec-cicd/use-appdome-build-2secure-in-gitlab/)\n* [How to Use Secure Android & iOS Apps in GitHub CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appdome-basics/use-appdomes-github-action/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

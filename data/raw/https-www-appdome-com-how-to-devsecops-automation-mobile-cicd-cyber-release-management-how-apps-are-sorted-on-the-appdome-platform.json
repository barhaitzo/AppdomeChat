This organization helps you select the correct version and build number for your projects. This article provides an overview of how to sort and manage apps on the [Appdome platform](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/what-is-the-appdome-platform/).\n\n## Organizing iOS and Android Apps on Appdome\n\nAppdome is a unified mobile app defense platform for Android & iOS apps. With Appdome, mobile brands bring together end-to-end automation for 400+ mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, anti-cheat, anti-bot, geo compliance, and other defenses in the mobile DevOps pipeline. Using a simple \u2018click to add\u2019 user interface, Appdome allows anyone to add mobile app security to any iOS or Android app in seconds, with no code or coding required. You can upload an Android or iOS app, select your choice of features from Appdome\u2019s Security category, and click \u201cBuild My App.\u201d The Appdome technology adds the chosen mobile security features to the app (plus any required standards or framework extensions) automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nUploaded apps are sorted on Appdome as follows:\n\n* OS: Bundle ID\n  + Version: versions of the app that share the same OS\n    - Build Number: builds that share the same version\n\nFor example: com.bundleID.appname.Version 35.9 (958)\n\n### Prerequisites for Locating an Uploaded App\n\nTo locate your app within Appdome\u2019s app library, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/) (paid/on-trial account)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or.apk or. aab for Android)\n* [Upload your app to the platform](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Finding and Selecting Your App\n\n1. **Locate Your App**: Find your app by OS and bundle ID listed on the left side of the screen.  \n   ![Select App](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2024-05-20-at-12.53.45.png)\n2. **Sort Your Apps**: You can sort your apps by timestamp, activity level, or alphabetically.  \n   ![Sort apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2024-05-20-at-12.56.58.png)\n3. Click the Appdome shield symbol at the top left of the screen to display the list of builds.  \n   ![Appdome shield](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2024-05-20-at-15.27.58.png)\n4. Select the app you want to build with Appdome security protections.  \n   ![Account Activity Log](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2024-05-21-at-14.57.08.png)\n5. **Build Your App**: Navigate to the \u201cBuild\u201d tab to start adding security features to your selected app.  \n   For more details on how to build your app with Appdome security protections, please refer to this knowledge base article:\u00a0[Using No-Code Security for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/using-no-code-security-for-android-ios-apps/)  \n   ![Build](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Build-2.png)\n\n### Additional Operations with Apps\n\nEnhance your app management with these additional functionalities:\n\n* Copy Bundle ID\n* Copy App ID\n* Release an app to a team\n* Delete an app  \n  ![Copy App ID](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2024-05-20-at-12.57.32.png)\n\n### Deleting an App on the Appdome Platform\n\nOn the Appdome platform, you have the option to manage your apps effectively, including the ability to delete any app versions you no longer need. It\u2019s important to understand the implications and process of deleting an app version as this action is irreversible and can impact Appdome\u2019s ability to resolve support cases quickly.\n\nYou will be presented with two options:\n\n**Permanently Remove All Builds:** This option will immediately delete all builds associated with the app version.\n\n**Keep Builds for 90 Days (Recommended):** This option is recommended as it keeps the builds accessible to Appdome\u2019s Support team for 90 days, aiding in any potential ticket resolution. After 90 days, the app will automatically be deleted from the library.\n\n**Confirm Deletion:** Select your preferred deletion method and confirm by clicking \u201cYes, Delete the App\u201d or decide to keep the app by selecting \u201cNo, Keep the App.\u201d\n\n![Deleting An App From The Appdome Platform](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Deleting-an-app-from-the-Appdome-platform.png)\n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [How to Upload a Mobile App to Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/uploading-a-mobile-app-to-appdome/)\n* [How to Release Mobile App Security Templates between Teams](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/security-release-management/releasing-fusion-sets/)\n* [How to Control Content in PWA & Secure Uploads, Secure Downloads](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-mobile-work/secure-progressive-web-apps/control-content-in-pwa-secure-uploads-secure-downloads/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.2.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)!

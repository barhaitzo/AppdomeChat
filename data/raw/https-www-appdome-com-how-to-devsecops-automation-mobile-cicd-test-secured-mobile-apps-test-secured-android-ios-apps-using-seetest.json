Appdome works with all leading mobile automation testing solutions to help customers achieve comprehensive mobile app security at DevSecOps speed and agility, all within the app\u2019s existing application lifecycle.\n\n## **How to Test Appdome-secured Android Apps using SeeTest**\n\n1. Build your app with Appdome\u2019s protection.  \n   In order to use SeeTest, you need to enable Threat Events for Anti-Tampering, as shown below:  \n   ![Threateventsantitampering](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2024-02-25-at-15.08.15-942x731.png)\n2. After you finish securing your app on Appdome, go to <https://cloud.seetest.io>\u00a0 and login to your account.\n3. Go to the **Devices** section and select an available device of your choice.  \n   ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/seetest1-650x269.png)\n4. Click **Open** to launch the selected device.\n5. Click the **Applications** button ![Applicationsicon](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ApplicationsIcon-1.png)\u00a0on the left menu.  \n   ![Applicationsbutton](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ApplicationsButton-650x262.png)\n6. In the opened **APP MANAGER** window, select the \u201c**Device**\u201d tab, then click the \u201c**+**\u201d icon at the bottom.  \n   ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/seetest3-396x366.png)\n7. Upload your test app as instructed in the new screen.\n8. Go back to the **APP MANAGER** window, find your uploaded app.\n9. Click on the phone icon, then click \u201c**Install**\u201d to install the test app on the phone.  \n   ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/seetest4-393x366.png)\n10. Click **LAUNCH**. The test app will be launched on the phone.  \n    ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/seetest5-391x366.png)\n11. Go to the phone screen and test your app manually.\n\n## **Testing Appdome-secured iOS Apps using SeeTest**\n\n1. Build your app with your chosen Appdome security features.  \n   In order to use SeeTest, one of the following steps is required:  \n   a. Either Enable a [**Threat Event**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/threat-events/mobile-threat-events/how-to-implement-appdomes-oneshield-threat-events-2/) for \u201c**Detect App is Debuggable**\u201d  \n   OR  \n   b. When signing the app, use a provisioning profile that includes a \u201cdebuggable\u201d entitlement, and [sign the app using Appdome\u2019s automated app signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n2. Test the\u00a0secured iOS app by using SeeTest  \n   After successfully building and signing your app on Appdome, go to <https://cloud.seetest.io>\u00a0 and login to your account.\n   1. Go to the Devices section and select an available device of your choice.\n   2. Click **Open** to launch the selected device.\n   3. Click\u00a0the **Applications** button ![Applicationsicon](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ApplicationsIcon-1.png)\u00a0on the left menu.  \n      ![Applications Ios](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Applications-iOS-1-e1708866630800-382x366.png)\n   4. In the opened APP MANAGER window, select the \u201cDevice\u201d tab, then press the \u201c+\u201d icon at the bottom.  \n      ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2021-06-13_18-06-28-1-419x366.png)\n   5. Upload your test app as instructed in the new screen\n   6. Go back to the APP MANAGER window, find your uploaded app and click on the phone icon, it will display \u201cInstall\u201d. Click on it. Your chosen test app will be installed on the phone.  \n      ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2021-06-13_18-06-43-1-399x366.png)\n   7. Click LAUNCH. The test app will be launched on the phone.\n   8. Go to the phone screen and test your app manually.\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n\nMost automation test tools can typically be used in one of two modes: **emulator mode** and **manual mode** (specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cemulator mode\u201d instead of \u201cmanual mode\u201d, the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device. This is expected because Appdome [ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) protects apps from running on emulators/simulators.\u00a0 Instead, you should run the automation test tool in manual mode.\n\nIf you see a message such as: \u201cApplication has violated security policies and it will be shut down\u201d, this means that (1) techniques such as emulators, tampering, or reverse engineering are present, and (2) the [Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/build-security-template-android-ios-apps/) does not contain Appdome Threat-Events. This is expected because Appdome ONEShield protects against those conditions. You can either remove the triggering condition or use [Appdome Threat Events](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/threat-events/mobile-threat-events/how-to-implement-appdomes-oneshield-threat-events-2/) if applicable.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps Using a Trusted ARM Emulator, Mobile DevSecOps Best Practices](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/test-secured-android-apps-using-a-trusted-arm-emulator-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n* [Testing Secured Android & iOS Apps Using Robotest, Mobile DevSecOps Best Practices](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-using-robotest-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n* [Testing Secured Android & iOS Apps Using SeeTest, Mobile DevSecOps Best Practices](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-android-ios-apps-using-seetest/)\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build-to-Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [Crashing vs Closing in Secured Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/crashing-vs-closing-in-secured-android-ios-apps/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.cb249e6cb815c754ee1ea4633650c79f.1683458843950.1683458843950.1683547752843.2&__hssc=79098507.1.1683547752843&__hsfp=3783124442)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.cb249e6cb815c754ee1ea4633650c79f.1683458843950.1683458843950.1683547752843.2&__hssc=79098507.1.1683547752843&__hsfp=3783124442)!

Once TeaBot infects a device, it can perform keylogging to capture sensitive data, intercept MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) codes sent via SMS, and grant remote access to attackers, which allows them to simulate user actions on the infected app. TeaBot often disguises itself as legitimate applications, such as QR code scanners or media players, to evade detection. With frequent updates, TeaBot adapts to security measures and continues to evolve in targeting financial and personal apps across multiple regions.\n\n## **Why Protect Android Apps from TeaBot?**\n\nDefending against TeaBot is critical due to its ability to intercept SMS-based OTPs, perform real-time account takeovers, and capture login credentials through keylogging and screen recording. These features expose user accounts to unauthorized access, financial theft, and fraud. Additionally, TeaBot\u2019s remote control capabilities allow it to bypass security protections like 2FA by automating fraudulent transactions. Preventing TeaBot infection is essential for maintaining user data integrity and ensuring compliance with anti-fraud regulations in financial and enterprise applications. Furthermore, TeaBot\u2019s disguise as legitimate applications emphasizes the need for app validation to avoid unintentionally downloading such malware.\n\n## **How does Appdome Protect Mobile Apps Against TeaBot?**\n\nYou can protect mobile apps against TeaBot using the following Appdome protections:\n\n1. **[RASP](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/?__hstc=267077713.0268c95737dae91efe33ed3ee5dcf757.1723091225961.1729882144251.1729884612239.70&__hssc=267077713.2.1729884612239&__hsfp=3625334234)** \u2013 Prevents TeaBot from injecting itself into installed apps and repackaging them. Also includes anti-tampering, anti-debugging, anti-emulator, and other protections against dynamic attacks at runtime.\n2. [**Code Obfuscation**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-code-obfuscation/?__hstc=267077713.0268c95737dae91efe33ed3ee5dcf757.1723091225961.1729882144251.1729884612239.70&__hssc=267077713.2.1729884612239&__hsfp=3625334234)\u00a0\u2013 Protects against decompiling and malicious reverse engineering.\n3. [**Root Detection**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/jailbreak-root-detection/build-root-detection-protect-android-apps/?__hstc=267077713.0268c95737dae91efe33ed3ee5dcf757.1723091225961.1729882144251.1729884612239.70&__hssc=267077713.2.1729884612239&__hsfp=3625334234) \u2013 Protects mobile apps from running on rooted devices, which bypass Android\u2019s security controls. Rooting exposes apps to tampering, data theft, and malware by giving attackers elevated access to system files and app data.\n4. [**Prevent Screen Sharing Scams & Malware**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/anti-spyware-android-ios/protect-android-apps-from-screen-sharing-malware/) \u2013 Prevents malware from abusing screen recording and screen sharing functions to benefit the malware.\n5. [**Accessibility Service Malware Prevention**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/ato-prevention/prevent-accessibility-service-malware-on-android-apps/) \u2013 Defends against attacks by blocking malicious apps, detecting specific attacks, and allowing trusted services through a whitelist. Ensures that the app closes and the user receives a notification informing them about the detection and suggesting the option to turn off their Accessibility Services via the settings.\n6. **[Keylogger Prevention](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/ato-prevention/protect-android-ios-apps-from-keylogging-malware/)** \u2013 Prevents malicious recording of key strokes by mobile app users.\n\nTo learn more about activating these security protections in your mobile apps, please refer to the related articles section of this knowledge base article.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against CraxsRAT Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/know-your-customer-checks/protect-android-apps-against-craxsrat/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against BrasDex Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/android-malware-detection/protect-android-apps-against-brasdex-malware/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against Xenomorph Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/android-malware-detection/protect-android-apps-against-xenomorph-malware/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against FjordPhantom Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/know-your-customer-checks/protect-android-ios-apps-against-fjordphantom/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against Panda Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-cheat-prevention/fake-app-trojan-defense/protect-android-apps-against-panda/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against Brokewell Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-cheat-prevention/fake-app-trojan-defense/protect-android-apps-against-brokewell/)\n* [How to Protect Android Apps Against Hiddad Malware](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/android-malware-detection/protect-android-apps-against-hiddad/)\n\n## How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1722429384209.1722763941381.517&__hssc=79098507.3.1722763941381&__hsfp=3642047999)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1722429384209.1722763941381.517&__hssc=79098507.3.1722763941381&__hsfp=3642047999)!

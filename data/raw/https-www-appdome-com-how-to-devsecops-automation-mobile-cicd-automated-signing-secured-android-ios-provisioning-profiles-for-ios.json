You only need to provide the signing credentials. For details, see topic [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/).\n\n* **Private Signing**Gives you full responsibility for handling the entire signing process. For more details, see [How to Privately Code Sign Sealed iOS Apps using DevSecOps Build System](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/privately-code-sign-sealed-ios-apps-using-devsecops-build-system).\n\n* **Auto-DEV Private Signing**Allows you to sign the app without uploading the signing certificate to Appdome\u2019s cloud service.  \n  Appdome provides you with a script (.sh file), which runs on your trusted environment and signs the app by using your credentials \u00a0 \u00a0(certificate and password) as input. For more details, see [How to Automate Secure iOS App Code Signing in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/automate-secure-ios-app-code-signing-in-devops-cicd/).\n\nAs part of the Appdome signing process of secured iOS apps, by using either Auto-dev Private Signing or Signing on Appdome, you are required to extract and upload a **Provisioning Profile** and an [**entitlement**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/extract-and-use-ios-entitlements-files-for-signing-secured-ios-app/) file **for each executable** in the app, and when using signing on Appdome, a [**P12 certificate and its password**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/p12-certificate-file/).\n\n## Extracting a Provisioning Profile\n\n**To extract a provisioning file for distribution to Appstore**:\n\n1. From your selected browser, go to [iOS Dev Center](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter) and sign in with your Apple ID.\n2. In the iOS Dev Center, click\u00a0**Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**.  \n   ![Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles in iOS Dev Center](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-04-at-9.39.06-650x276.png)\n3. Go to **Profiles**.\n4. Click +.\n5. Select the requested Distribution/Development type.  \n   ![Select requested Distribution/Development type when registering a new provisioning profile](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-04-at-9.40.56-387x366.png)\n6. Select an App or plugin ID.\n7. Select a certificate to include in the provisioning profile and click\u00a0**Continue.**\n8. Enter a name for the profile and click **Generate**.\n9. (Optional) Click **Download** to download the provisioning profile.  \n   Here is an example of a provisioning profile\u00a0file (can be opened by any text editor):\n\nIn order to sign an iOS executable, you need to define each executable\u2019s capabilities and permissions via the executable\u2019s entitlements.  \nThe entitlements are part of the signature and are embedded into the executable.\n\nIf the app does not request an entitlement, the OS will not allow the matching application service at run time. Examples of entitlements are push notifications, App-Groups (allow IPC between applications on the same device), Keychain access groups, and iCloud.\n\nThe image below displays an example of an entitlements file, which can be opened and edited by any text editor.\n\n![An example of an entitlements file](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-04-at-9.51.01-650x355.png)\n\nCongratulations! You have now extracted the provisioning profile file required to sign your secured iOS application.\n\n## How to use the obtained provisioning profile\n\nYou can use this provisioning profile when exporting your application from XCode.  \nAfter archiving your application, select the type of your provisioning profile:\n\n![Select distribution method](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SelectDistMethod-609x366.png)\n\nThen select the provisioning profile you have generated and download it:\n\n![Select ad-hoc iOS provisioning profile](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SelectProvisioninProfile-607x366.png)\n\nYou can also use this provisioning profile when signing your application on Appdome\u2019s platform.\n\nAfter performing the above steps and generating provisioning profiles for all your application\u2019s executables, you can upload it on the **Sign** tab to either the **On Appdome** signing or **Auto-DEV Private Signing**.\n\n![Upload a selected provisioning profile](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SelectSighMethod-650x89.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How do I extract the target bundle identifier from provisioning profile file?**\n\n1. Open your file.mobileprovision file in a text editor.\n2. Look for the application-identifier key, which is stored in the Entitlements section inside your provisioning profile file.  \n   The value for this key is a prefix with the team identifier used when generating this target, followed by the target bundle identifier.\n\n**How do I extract the target team identifier from provisioning profile file?**\n\n1. Open your **file.mobileprovision** file in a text editor.\n2. Look for the **com.apple.developer.team-identifier** key, which is stored\u00a0in the **Entitlements** section inside your provisioning profile file.  \n   The value for this key is the team identifier.\n\n**How do I determine the type of the provisioning profile file?**\n\n1. Open your **file.mobileprovision** file in a text editor.\n2. Look for the **aps-environment** key, \u00a0which is stored\u00a0in the **Entitlements** section inside your provisioning profile file.  \n   If this value is **development**, then this the provisioning profile file\u2019s\u00a0type.\n3. Look for the key get-task-allow.  \n   If the value of this key is True, the provisioning profile file\u2019s\u00a0type is **development**.\n4. If you failed to find the file\u2019s type, and the key **ProvisionedDevices** exists, the type is Ad-Hoc.\n\n**How do I determine whether the provisioning profile expired?**\n\n1. Open your file.mobileprovision file in a text editor.\n2. Look for the **ExpirationDate** key.  \n   If the value indicated in this key is earlier than today, your profile has expired.\n\n**What is the difference between the Entitlements section in my provisioning profile file and the entitlements used to sign my application?**\n\nThe entitlements used to sign your application are being saved in the derived data folder by XCode. They are the entitlements your application is using.\n\nThe entitlements section that the provisioning profile file contains are the entitlements you declared for your application in your Apple developer account when generating your provisioning profile\n\n## **Related Articles**\n\n* [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n* [How To Sign Secured Android Apps Without Android Studio](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/)\n* [signing apps with Extension or Frameworks](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-apple-watchkit-apps-without-xcode/).\n* [Request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1679322760586.1679391001880.3&__hssc=267077713.3.1679391001880&__hsfp=2327634395)!

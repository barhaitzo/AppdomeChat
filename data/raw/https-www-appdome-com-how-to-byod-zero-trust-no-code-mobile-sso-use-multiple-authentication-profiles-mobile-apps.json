This Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for using Appdome to use multiple authentication profiles in mobile apps\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Use Multiple Authentication Profiles in Mobile Apps\n\nAdding multiple authentication profiles to a single app is an extremely important use case for security conscious organizations. \u00a0These organizations often use different authentication methods or identity providers to gate access to specific IPs and sensitive information.\u00a0In many cases, business to business, business to enterprise, and other Android and iOS mobile apps aren\u2019t built to access protected resources. Moreover,\u00a0mobile apps aren\u2019t designed to use\u00a0**multiple** or\u00a0**different**\u00a0authentication methods or SSO providers depending on the app\u2019s use. The big question is, how does an app maker or enterprise organization allow **multiple** or\u00a0**different**\u00a0authentication methods or SSO providers **per** protected resource or\u00a0multiple protected resources?\n\n[Appdome for Single Sign-On](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/appdome-for-sso-a-better-way-to-add-sso-to-mobile-apps/)\u00a0allows Appdome users to create and add multiple authentication profiles directly to mobile apps. Use Appdome for SSO+ is easy and quick. In a few clicks and zero-coding, profiles for\u00a0**all**\u00a0authentication providers can be added to **all** of the organizational internal and third-party apps. Appdome GO provides a simple interface to apply multi SSO profiles to multiple apps. To learn more about Appdome GO templates please refer to Share Templates Using Appdome GO\u00a0[knowledge base.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/)\n\nAppdome is a mobile integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that allows users to add a wide variety of features, SDKs, and APIs to Android and iOS apps. Using a simple\u00a0\u2018click to add\u2019 user interface, Appdome allows anyone to easily integrate multi-authentication profiles to any mobile app \u2013 instantly, no code or coding required.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome for SSO+\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of Multi Authentication Profiles on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Organizational SSO Authentication Providers Details:\n  + [Mobile Enterprise Authentication by Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-mobile-sso/use-modern-authentication-android-ios-apps/)\n  + [OKTA Identity Cloud](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/no-code-okta-single-sign-on/)\n  + [Azure Identity Cloud](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-identity/build-mobile-apps-sso-microsoft-azure-ad/)\n  + [Microsoft Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-identity/make-mobile-apps-work-ntlm-authentication/)\n  + [Ping Identity Cloud](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/add-ping-sso-to-any-mobile-app-fast/)\n  + [F5 Access Policy Manager](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/integrate-f5-apm/)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## The 7 Steps to Use Multiple Authentication Profiles in Mobile Apps\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add Multiple Authentication Profiles to Any Mobile App:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n### From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add Multiple Authentication\u00a0Profiles\n\nSelect the **Build**Tab.\u00a0*Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*Beneath the\u00a0**Build** Tab, you will find several service options.

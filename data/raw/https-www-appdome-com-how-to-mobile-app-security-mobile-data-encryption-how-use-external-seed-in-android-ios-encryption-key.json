This results in the derivation of a unique encryption key. The Data at Rest encryption key will be seeded via Appdome Input Threat-Events. With Input-Events\u2122, you can use Appdome to handle in-app events and seed your key internally.\n\n### Prerequisites for In-App Generated Seed For Data at Rest Encryption\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Appdome-DEV access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)\u00a0software\n* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)\u00a0software\n* Visual Studio with\u00a0[tools for Maui, Xamarin](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/)\u00a0(for Maui, Xamarin Apps)\n* [Cordova\u00a0mobile development framework](https://cordova.apache.org/)\u00a0(for Cordova Apps)\n\nThere are some app developer steps you can take with apps to set an external seed to receive the key that is being sent for Data-at-Rest encryption.\n\n## Using Input Threat-Events\u2122 for In-App Generated Seed in Mobile Apps\n\nUse the following code to input the external seed for the key with **Data at Rest** **Encryption** for iOS and Android.\n\n**Note:** Input Threat Events are unavailable for multi-platform frameworks such as React Native, Flutter, and Cardova. If you are using these coding languages, it is recommended that you build a bridge class that acts as an intermediary between the framework and the mobile native API.\n\n### Java\n\n```\n// Define placeholders for key and value\r\nString key = \"Seed\";\r\nString value = \"<SECRET_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER>\";\r\n \r\n// Create a new intent with the action \"SeedDataAtRest\"\r\n\r\nIntent intent = new

Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI, or other system:\n\n       - Build an API for the app \u2013 for instructions, see the tasks under\u00a0[Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link?__hstc=267077713.28abf8ad5abd079e57f8c5606075ba57.1702471003737.1717588253698.1717591236546.375&__hssc=267077713.3.1717591236546&__hsfp=4199485786)\n       - Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/orgs/Appdome/repositories)\n3. ##### Building the Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed feature via\u00a0Appdome Console\n\n   Follow the instructions below to build the Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed protection using the Appdome Console.\n\n   * **Where:**\u00a0Inside the Appdome Console, go to\u00a0**Build**>\u00a0**Security**\u00a0Tab >\u00a0**TOTALData\u2122 Encryption**\u00a0section.\n   * **How:**\u00a0Toggle (turn ON)**Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed**, as shown below.  \n     ***Note:*** In order to enable the In-App Generated Seed feature, make sure that your app contains the \u201cSeedDataAtRest\u201d Threat Event implementation.![Data At Rest Encryption > In App Generated Seed Option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Data-at-Rest-Encryption-In-App-Generated-Seed-option-1.png)\n   * Figure 3: Initialize In-App Generated Seed option\n   * When you select the Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed, you\u2019ll notice that the Fusion Set you created now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed.\n\n     ![Fusion Set applied Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Security_TOTALData-Encyption_Data-at-Rest-Encryption_In-App-Generated-Seed_FS-applied-Android.png)\n\n     Figure 4: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed protection\n   * Click\u00a0**Build My App**\u00a0at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in\u00a0[Figure

    **Congratulations!** The In-App Generated Seed protection has now been added to the mobile app.\n4. ##### Certify the Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed feature in Mobile Apps\n\n   After building Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the In-App Generated Seed protection has been added and is protecting the app.  \n   To verify that In-App Generated Seed protection has been added to the mobile app, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:  \n   ![Myandroidapp Certificate In App Generated Seed](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MyAndroidApp-Certificate-In-App-Generated-Seed.png)  \n   Figure 5: Certified Secure\u2122 certificate  \n   Each Certified Secure\u2122 certificate provides DevOps and DevSecOps organizations with the entire workflow summary, audit trail of each build, and proof of protection that Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed has been added to each Mobile app. Certified Secure provides instant and in-line DevSecOps compliance certification that Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed and other mobile app security features are in each build of the mobile app.\n\n## How to Sign & Publish Secured Mobile Apps Built on\u00a0Appdome\n\nAfter successfully securing your app

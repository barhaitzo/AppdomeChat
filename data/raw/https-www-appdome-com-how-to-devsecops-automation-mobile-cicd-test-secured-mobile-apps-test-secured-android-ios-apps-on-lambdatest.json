With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida. For details, see [How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## **Which Appdome Security Protections May be Triggered due to Lambdatest\u2019s Test Environment**\n\nWhen using\u00a0Lambdatest\u00a0to run Real Device App Testing or App Automation testing on an Appdome-protected app, you can choose between either of the following methods:\n\nThe following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered and the reason why.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Detect Developer Options | Required to interact with the device | The app will detect this but will not crash, allowing testing to continue. |\n| Block Android Debug Bridge (ADB) | Required to interact with the device | The app will detect ADB usage but will not crash, ensuring smooth testing. |\n| Prevent App Screen Sharing | Lambdatest performs screen recording, so if this feature is enabled, all test videos might show a black screen. | The app will detect the screen recording but will continue running without crashing, allowing for uninterrupted testing. |\n| Prevent Keystroke Injection | Lambdatest uses the adb command to enter text. screen | The app will detect the use of the adb command but will continue running without crashing, allowing for uninterrupted testing. |\n| Secure App Signature | Lambdatest resigns the app upon installation | The app will detect the signature change but will not crash, allowing the testing to continue without interruption. |\n| Prevent Auto-Clickers Permissions | Lambdatest might flag anomalies that signal the use of auto-clickers. | The app will detect auto-clicking activity but will continue operating normally, allowing testing to proceed without crashes. |\n| Keylogging Prevention | Testing scripts that simulate inputs in a way that resembles keylogging might trigger this feature. | The app will detect potential keylogging behavior but will not crash. |\n| Block Memory Editing Tools | Activated if memory editing tools attempt to modify the app\u2019s memory during runtime. | The app will detect the use of memory editing tools but will continue running without crashing, allowing for uninterrupted testing. |\n\n## **Testing .aab Apps**\n\nUnlike .apk apps, .aab apps must be re-signed before installation.\n\nTo avoid triggering Appdome\u2019s anti-tampering protection as a result of the re-signing process, you can use **either** of the following options:\n\n* Convert the test .aab app into Universal.apk by using the same key that was used for signing the .aab app, and use the Universal.apk file to test with Lambdatest.\n\n## **Real Device (Live) App Testing \u2013 Android**\n\n**To initiate a** **Real Device (Live) App****test of your test app in\u00a0Lambdatest**:\n\n1. [**Log in to your** **Lambdatest** **account**](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login). Alternatively, if you do not yet have an account, [**Create an account**](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).\n2. On the menu on the right bar, click\u00a0**Real Device > App Testing**.  \n   You will now see a list of previously uploaded iOS and Android apps.  \n   ![Previosulydisplayedapps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PreviosulyDisplayedApps-650x353.png)\n3. Select the **Android** platform on the left side of the screen.\n4. Select your app to test from the apps list.\n\n   **Note:** If you have not previously uploaded your app, you can do it now by clicking on **UPLOAD** to upload the app directly from your computer, or **URL** to obtain the app from somewhere else.\n5. Select a test device of your choice by selecting its brand, device name, and OS version from the list on the right.\n6. Click\u00a0**Start**\u00a0to start testing.  \n   ![Starttesting](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/StartTesting-469x366.png)  \n   The app will be automatically installed on the selected device and then launched. The app\u2019s device control buttons are displayed on the left.\n7. Click the app on the screen to use it.\n8. When done, click\u00a0**End Session** (red button on the left side of the screen).\n\n## Automating App Testing on Android\n\nLambdatest\u00a0has several Appium capabilities, namely: a series of key-value pairs that allow you to configure your tests on Lambdatest. For further details, see the [Capabilities Builder \u2013 Appium](https://www.browserstack.com/app-automate/capabilities) webpage.\n\nThe network Log Appium capability may trigger Appdome protection features, as specified below.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Lambdatest-Specific Appium Capability** | **Reason** |\n| networkLog | By default, Lambdatest re-signs the app to enable capturing network log |\n| networkLog | Lambdatest uses a MitM proxy |\n\n**Note**:\n\nFor additional measures to take during app build on Appdome, see the above sections **Testing on Android Apps** and\u00a0**Testing .aab Apps**.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n* Most automation test tools can typically be used in one of two modes:\u00a0**emulator mode**and\u00a0**real device****mode**(specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cemulator mode\u201d instead of \u201creal device mode,\u201d the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device. This is expected because Appdome [ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) protects apps from running on emulators/simulators. Instead, it would help if you run the automation test tool on an actual device.\n\n## Demo: Build2Test Integration for LambdaTest\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [How to Test Appdome-secured iOS Apps on BrowserStack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-appdome-secured-ios-apps-by-using-browserstack/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on BrowserStack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-on-browserstack/)\n* [How to Test Appdome-Secured Android Apps on SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/appsec-release-orchestration-testing-protected-mobile-apps-test-appdome-secured-android-apps-by-using-saucelabs/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-saucelabs-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1679479945913.1679485395396.8&__hssc=267077713.4.1679485395396&__hsfp=2327634395)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1679479945913.1679485395396.8&__hssc=267077713.4.1679485395396&__hsfp=2327634395)!

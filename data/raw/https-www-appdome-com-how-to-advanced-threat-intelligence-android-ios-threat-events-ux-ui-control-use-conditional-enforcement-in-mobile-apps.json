Instead of immediately stopping the app, Appdome alerts developers, giving them the option to customize the timing and type of response. This flexibility is particularly beneficial when immediate termination might disrupt critical processes or negatively impact user experience. Conditional Enforcement empowers developers to manage responses effectively without compromising app usability, especially in cases where threat mitigation requires gradual escalation.\n\nAllowing tailored responses ensures app security while balancing operational needs, ultimately helping to comply with user experience guidelines and operational standards in regulated environments.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Mobile Apps With Conditional Enforcement?\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic Conditional Enforcement plugin provides developers the ability to trigger security actions only after receiving an input threat event and deciding the appropriate response. Once a threat is detected, Appdome alerts the app, but the developer determines the timing of actions like app exit or functionality restriction.  \nThis empowers developers to align security responses with business logic, operational workflows, or user experience priorities, ensuring that protective actions occur at the most appropriate time.\n\n## Why Developers Might Use Conditional Enforcement\n\nThis feature is beneficial for those who need to tailor their app\u2019s security responses to specific operational requirements. By choosing when to terminate the app after a threat is detected, developers can ensure that essential processes are completed and user experience is not unnecessarily disrupted.\n\n## Prerequisites for using Appdome Conditional Enforcement\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.28abf8ad5abd079e57f8c5606075ba57.1702471003737.1718628333504.1718634418622.402&__hssc=267077713.1.1718634418622&__hsfp=2335033740)\u00a0\u2013 Appdome DEV or Higher.\n* [Threat-Events license](https://www.appdome.com/appdome-pricing/?__hstc=267077713.28abf8ad5abd079e57f8c5606075ba57.1702471003737.1718628333504.1718634418622.402&__hssc=267077713.1.1718634418622&__hsfp=2335033740)\n* A license for Conditional Enforcement\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project?__hstc=267077713.28abf8ad5abd079e57f8c5606075ba57.1702471003737.1718628333504.1718634418622.402&__hssc=267077713.1.1718634418622&__hsfp=2335033740)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile) \u2013 see Signing Secure Android apps and Signing Secure iOS apps.\n* Threat-Events have been enabled ( turned ON) for the specific protection  \n  You are using the correct identifiers for the Threat-Events for each protection.\n\n## Using Input Threat-Events\u2122 for Conditional Enforcement in Mobile Apps\n\nBefore enabling the Conditional Enforcement feature, ensure your app has been uploaded to the Appdome platform with the necessary input threat event, as shown in the following code example. This is crucial for the feature to function correctly.\n\n**Note:** Input Threat Events are not natively supported for multi-platform frameworks such as React Native, Flutter, and Cordova. If you are using these coding languages, it is recommended that you build a bridge class that acts as an intermediary between the framework and the mobile native API.\n\nFor more details on how to build bridging classes for Flutter and Cordova, please refer to the following documentation: [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels) and\u00a0[Cordova Plugin Development Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/10.x/guide/hybrid/plugins/).\n\n### Java\n\nWhen setting up threat events for Java-coded apps, please refer to this KB:\u00a0[Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Native Android Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-native-android-apps/)  \nWe recommend adding the conditional enforcement operation to ensure that your mobile app\n\n```\nString action = intent.getAction();\r\nswitch (action) {\r\n  case ROOTED_DEVICE:\r\n  //\r\n  // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here, as seen above\r\n  //\r\n  // Notify Appdome to enforce the Threat Event after Threat Event is handled \r\n  Intent newIntent = new Intent(\"ConditionalEnforcementEvent\"); \r\n  newIntent.putExtras(intent.getExtras()); \r\n  newIntent.setPackage(context.getPackageName()); \r\n  context.sendBroadcast(newIntent);\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Kotlin\n\n```\nval action = intent.action\r\nwhen (action) { \r\n  \"RootedDevice\" -> { \r\n    // \r\n    // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here, as seen above \r\n    // Notify Appdome to enforce the Threat Event after Threat Event is handled\r\n    val newIntent = Intent(\"ConditionalEnforcementEvent\").apply {\r\n      putExtras(intent.extras)\r\n    }\r\n    context.sendBroadcast(newIntent)\r\n  }\r\n}\n```\n\n#### Xamarin/MAUI Android \u2013 CSharp\n\n```\nString action = intent.getAction();\r\nswitch (action) { \r\n  case ROOTED_DEVICE: \r\n  // \r\n  // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here, as seen above \r\n  //\r\n\r\n  // Notify Appdome to enforce the Threat Event after Threat Event is handled\r\n  Intent newIntent = new Intent(\"ConditionalEnforcementEvent\");\r\n  newIntent.PutExtras(intent.GetExtras());\r\n  newIntent.SetPackage(ApplicationContext.PackageName);\r\n  ApplicationContext.SendBroadcast(newIntent);\r\n}\n```\n\n### Objective-C\n\n```\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName: @\"JailbrokenDevice\" object:nil queue:nil usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {\r\n    NSDictionary *userInfo = [note userInfo];\r\n    if (userInfo == nil) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here\r\n    //\r\n    \r\n    // Notify Appdome to enforce the Threat Event after Threat Event is handled\r\n    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@\"ConditionalEnforcementEvent\" object:nil userInfo:userInfo];\r\n}];\n```\n\n### Swift\n\n```\nNotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: NSNotification.Name(\"JailbrokenDevice\"), object: nil, queue: nil) { notification in\r\n    guard let userInfo = notification.userInfo else {\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n//\r\n// Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here\r\n//\r\n\r\n// Notify Appdome to enforce the Threat Event after Threat Event is handled\r\nNotificationCenter.default.post(name: NSNotification.Name(\"ConditionalEnforcementEvent\"), object: nil, userInfo:userInfo)\n```\n\n### Xamarin/MAUI iOS -CSharp\n\n```\nNSNotificationCenter.DefaultCenter.AddObserver(\r\n  (NSString)\"BlockedClipboardEvent\",\r\n  delegate (NSNotification obj) {\r\n   Console.WriteLine(\"iOS Copy Paste Threat Event obj : {0}\", obj);\r\n    //\r\n    // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here, as seen above\r\n    //\r\n \r\n    // Notify Appdome to enforce the Threat Event after Threat Event is handled\r\n    NSNotificationCenter.DefaultCenter.PostNotificationName((NSString)\"ConditionalEnforcementEvent\", null, obj.UserInfo);\r\n  });\r\n```\n\n## How to Enable Conditional Enforcement\n\nThe figure below shows where you can find the Conditional Enforcement feature for each of the runtime mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile antibot, and other protections available on Appdome.\n\n**NOTE:** We have used Root Detection as an example; you can enable Conditional Enforcement for any feature that includes Threat Events.\n\n1.

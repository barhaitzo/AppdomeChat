SCEP certificates can be used by mobile apps integrated with Microsoft Intune and a secure access client to authenticate connections from the mobile app to a proxy, reverse proxy, SSL VPN, or industry-standard VPN to access protected resources.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides detailed information about how to automatically add client-side certificates from Intune and secure access client to a mobile app so it can connect and authenticate to an SSL gateway, proxy/ reverse proxy, or industry-standard VPN.\n\n## How to Use Microsoft SCEP Certificates with Intune App SDK\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features, like the Microsoft Intune App SDK in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on SCEP, Intune, client-side certificates or any other authentication standard inside the app. The Appdome technology adds SCEP distributed client-side certificates and relevant standards, frameworks and more to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all. Using Appdome, mobile apps will use SCEP distributed client-side certificates to identify and authenticate users as if SCEP distributed client-side certificates was natively coded to the app.\n\n### Prerequisites to Enable SCEP for Microsoft Authentication with MicroVPN\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of MicroVPN on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Enterprise-grade SSL gateway, proxy, reverse proxy, or industry-standard VPN that is the authentication or termination endpoint for the MicroVPN\n* List of internal domains the mobile app is trying to reach\n* [NDES (Network Device Enrollment Service)](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/9063.active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs-network-device-enrollment-service-ndes.aspx), which is Microsoft\u2019s implementation of SCEP, connected to the organization CA\n  + In order for Appdome to be able to reach your NDES server, it needs to be configured not to require one time passwords. On the NDES server, in Registry Editor, set the following key to 0 (zero):  \n    HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Microsoft > Cryptography > MSCEP > EnforcePassword > EnforcePassword\n* [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune) server\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## Operation of Appdome MicroVPN with Mobile Apps\n\nWith Appdome,\u00a0each\u00a0mobile app can receive one or more SCEP profiles and does not use a device profile as required by some EMM or VPN solution.\u00a0 Apps are placed into a security group that is unique to Appdome, and each app\u00a0utilizes the URI and certificates specified in the SCEP server for authentication and authorization. That means that rather than having the whole device managed with one policy, there can be separate security policies for each app, even on BYOD devices.\u00a0 Appdome supports multiple SCEP configurations for each app. If the Built app accesses more then one server, each server (or group of servers) gets its own certificate and this policy. This allows for a high-level of customization and policy granularity.\n\nNote: built apps extract their user id from the Microsoft Intune SDK and send a client-side certificate with that user ID to the NDES server for signing. This enables built apps to authenticate using unique client-side certificates for each user to the Enterprise Gateway.\n\n## The Easy Steps to Use Microsoft SCEP Certificates with Intune App SDK\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add Intune Client-Side Certificates for Authentication to Any Mobile App:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n### **From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add Intune SDK and MicroVPN**\n\nSelect the **Build\u00a0Tab**.\u00a0*Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*\n\nThe **Intune SDK** resides in the **Management tab** and the **MicroVPN**\u00a0**by Appdome** resides in the **Access tab**.\n\nDetailed instructions for using Appdome to integrating an app with MicroVPN and the Intune SDK are available in the article on [Integrating Apps with the Microsoft Intune SDK and MicroVPN without coding](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/make-mobile-apps-work-intune-microvpn/).For setting up certificates to use with the MicroVPN connection, Appdome offers two options. **Static Certificates**, which are added to your app during Fusion, and **Dynamic Certificates**, which are distributed via your SCEP server and are personalized, meaning they contain the user\u2019s Microsoft Intune unique identifier. These certificates, besides providing security for your connection, provide means of user identification based on user identifier supplied by Intune.\n\nIf selecting both, Appdome will, when hardening a connection, first try to pin a personal Dynamic Certificate. If it is not available, for example, SCEP server took time to answer or was not reachable, it will use a static certificate. If neither is available, the connection will be prevented from leaving the mobile device.\n\nTo set up a Static Certificate **(1)**, turn ON\u00a0 \u201cStatic Client Pinning\u201d checkbox and upload your .pem and .key files.\n\nTo set up Dynamic Certificates **(2)**, turn ON\u00a0 \u201cDynamic Client Pinning\u201d, and enter your SCEP server URL.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation2-3.png)\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0You now have a mobile app fully integrated with MicroVPN and Intune Client-Side Certificates.\n\n## **After Adding Intune Client-Side Certificates to\u00a0 Any Mobile App for Authentication**\n\nAfter you have added\u00a0Dynamic Client Pinning using Microsoft Intune and SCEP server,\u00a0to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\nPlease view the article here on [How to Complete My Mobile Integration Project After I Build My App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-complete-your-mobile-app-integration-project-after-integrating-your-mobile-app-on-appdome/).\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome for Microsoft ADAL SSO in your application!\n\n### **How Do I Learn More?**\n\nCheck out\u00a0[No-Code Microsoft\u00a0Authentication for Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/enterprise-mobile-apps/mobile-iam/microsoft-identity/), check out this [blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/add-microsoft-intune-mobile-apps/) or\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

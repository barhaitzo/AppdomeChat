This article will demonstrate how to export Appdome fusion sets in PDF file format.\n\nFor more details on fusion sets, please refer to the article: [How to Manage Fusion Set Security Templates iOS/Android](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/manage-fusion-set-security-templates-iosandroid/).\n\n## Fusion Set Export Feature Overview\n\nAppdome\u2019s Fusion Set Export feature enhances mobile app security management by providing a detailed PDF report of an app\u2019s security configuration. This report is divided into three pivotal sections:\n\n1. **Licensed and Enabled Features**: This section lists all security features that your company has licensed and activated. It ensures transparency and allows you to verify that all intended protections are operational.\n2. **Licensed but Not Enabled Features**: This section details the security features your account is licensed to use but has not activated. It is crucial for identifying available security measures that could further fortify your app.\n3. **Unlicensed Features**: This section identifies the features that your organization has not yet licensed on Appdome.  \n   Displaying unlicensed features serves a dual purpose: it provides a clear view of potential security functionalities that are currently unavailable to your application, and it aids in strategic decision-making regarding future security enhancements. By reviewing these unlicensed options, you can assess which additional features might be beneficial to adopt, thereby closing any gaps in your current security posture and enhancing overall protection for your mobile applications. This visibility supports proactive planning and ensures that your security measures can evolve in alignment with emerging threats and organizational needs.\n\n## Prerequisites for using the Fusion Set Overview\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher.

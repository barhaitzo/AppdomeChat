Once attached, attackers can inject malicious scripts, bypass security controls, inspect internal app logic, hook API functions, and modify critical app behaviors in real time. This method is commonly used to disable SSL pinning, extract sensitive data, and bypass authentication mechanisms, including the device passcode, posing severe risks to mobile apps and users. Since Frida Attach does not require app modifications, traditional static defenses fail to detect it, making real-time monitoring and blocking essential to prevent unauthorized runtime tampering.\n\n## How Appdome Protects iOS Apps Against Frida Attach\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic **Detect Frida Attach** plugin for iOS detects and blocks any attempts to attach the **Frida toolkit** to an application. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n* **Detects Frida Attach Attempts**: Monitors the app\u2019s environment during runtime to identify if any unauthorized Frida-based tools are attempting to attach to its processes.\n* **Blocks Attachment Attempts**: Immediately terminates the app session if a Frida Attach attempt is identified.\n\nThis feature is essential for protecting sensitive applications from external manipulation and ensuring a secure runtime environment for users and systems.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Appdome's Detect Frida Attach Plugins:\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s mobile app security build system to  **Detect Frida Attach** , you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **Detect Frida Attach**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS)\n* Signing Credentials (see [**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n## How to Implement Detect Frida Attach in iOS Apps Using Appdome\n\nOn Appdome, follow these **3 simple steps** to create self-defending iOS Apps that **Detect Frida Attach** without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1. ### [**Designate**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) the Mobile App to be protected.\n\n   1. #### Upload an app via the Appdome Mobile Defense platform GUI or via Appdome\u2019s DEV-API or CI/CD Plugins.\n   2. **iOS Formats:** .ipa\n   3. **Detect Frida Attach is compatible with:**\n      Obj-C, Java, Swift, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, Cordova and other iOS apps.\n2. ### Select the defense: **Detect Frida Attach**.****\n\n   1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the Detect Frida Attach feature as shown below:\n\n      ![fusion set that contains Detect Frida Attach](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/ios_fs_image.png)\n\n      Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Detect Frida Attach feature\n\n      1. Follow the steps in Sections [2.2-2.2.2](#2.2) of this article to add the Detect Frida Attach feature to your Fusion Set via the Appdome Console.\n      2. When you enable Anti Frida Detection Bypass you'll notice that the Fusion Set you created in step 2.1 now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Detect Frida Attach.\n\n         ![Fusion Set applied Detect Frida Attach](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Applied_FS_Detect_Frida_Attach.png)\n\n         Figure 2: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Detect Frida Attach protection\n           \n         Note: Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n      3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c...\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set. Copy\n         the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):\n         ![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/copy_fs_id.png)\n\n         Figure 3: Fusion Set Detail Summary\n      4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI or other system:\n         1. Refer to the [Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link) for API building instructions.\n         2. Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python).\n   2. #### Add the **Detect Frida Attach** feature to your security template.\n\n      1. Navigate to **Build**  > **Anti Malware** tab > **iOS Hacking Tool** section in the Appdome Console.\n\n         Like all other options in ONEShield\u2122, Detect Frida Attach is turned on by default, as shown below:\n         ![Detect Frida Attach option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Detect_Frida_Attach_Toggle.png)\n\n         Figure 4: Selecting Detect Frida Attach   \n         Note: The App Compromise Notification contains an easy to follow default remediation path for the mobile app end user. You can customize this message as required to achieve brand specific support, workflow or other messaging.\n\n      - Toggle On **Anti Frida Detection Bypass** > **Detect Frida Attach**.\n          \n\n        (a) Choose to monitor this attack vector by checking the Threat Events\n        checkbox associated with **Detect Frida Attach** as shown below.\n\n          \n\n        (b) To receive mobile Threat Monitoring, check the ThreatScope\u2122 box as shown below.\n        For more details, see our knowledge base article on [ThreatScope\u2122 Mobile XTM](/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-xtm/).\n\n        ![Detect Frida Attach option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Detect_Frida_Attach_Toggle.png)\n\n        Figure 4: Selecting Detect Frida Attach\n\n        Note:  The Appdome Platform displays the Mobile Operation Systems supported by each defense in real-time.\n        For more details, see our [OS Support Policy KB](/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-os-compatibility/appdome-support-and-eol-policies-for-mobile-oss-and-sdks/).\n\n      2. Select the Threat-Event\u2122 in-app mobile **Threat Defense and Intelligence** policy for **Detect Frida Attach**:  \n         1. **Threat-Events\u2122 OFF > In-App Defense** \n\n            If the Threat-Events\u2122 setting is not selected.\n            Appdome will detect and defend user and app by enforcing Detect Frida Attach.\n         2. **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > In-App Detection**\n\n            When this setting is used, Appdome detects Frida attach and passes Appdome\u2019s Threat-Event\u2122 attack intelligence to the app\u2019s business logic for processing, enforcement, and user notification.\n            For more information on consuming and using Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 in the app, see section Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Detect Frida Attach Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps.\n         3. **Threat-Events\u2122 ON > In-App Defense**\n\n            When this setting is used, Appdome detects and defends against Frida Attach (same as Appdome Enforce) and passes Appdome\u2019s Threat-Event\u2122 attack intelligence to the app\u2019s business logic for processing.\n            For more information on consuming and using Appdome Threat-Events\u2122 in the app, see section Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Detect Frida Attach Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps.\n      3. Configure the User Experience Options for **Detect Frida Attach**:\n           \n         With Threat-Events\u2122 OFF, Appdome provides several user experience options for mobile brands and developers.\n         1. App Compromise Notification: Customize the pop-up or toast Appdome uses to notify the user when a threat is present while using the protected mobile app.\n         2. Short message Option. This is available for mobile devices that allow a banner notification for security events.\n         3. Localized Message Option. Allows Appdome users to support global languages in security notifications.\n\n            ![Localized Message](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/localized_message.png)\n\n            Figure 5: Default User Experience Options for Appdome\u2019s **Frida Attach**\n         4. **Detect Frida Attach** Threat Code\u2122. Appdome uses AI to generate a unique code each time\n            **Detect Frida Attach** is triggered by an active threat on the mobile device.\n            Use the code in Appdome Threat Resolution Center\u2122 to help end users identify, find and resolve active threats on the personal mobile devices.\n   3. Initiate the build command either by clicking **Build My App** at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in Figure 4)\n      or via your CI/CD as described in Section [2.1.4](#2.1.4).\n\n   **Congratulations!** The Detect Frida Attach protection is now added to the mobile app\n3. ### **Certify the Detect Frida Attach feature in iOS Apps**\n\n   After building Detect Frida Attach, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the Detect Frida Attach protection has been added and is protecting the app. To verify that the Detect Frida Attach protection has been added to the mobile app, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:\n   ![Detect Frida Attach shown in Certificate secure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OS_Certificate_Detect_Frida_Attach.png)\n\n   Figure 6: Certified Secure\u2122 certificate\n\n   Each Certified Secure\u2122 certificate provides DevOps and DevSecOps organizations the entire workflow summary, audit trail of each build, and proof of protection that Detect Frida Attach has been added to each iOS app. Certified Secure provides instant and in-line DevSecOps compliance certification that Detect Frida Attach and other mobile app security features are in each build of the mobile app.\n\n## Using Threat-Events\u2122 for Frida Attach Intelligence and Control in iOS Apps\n\nAppdome Threat-Events\u2122 provides consumable in-app mobile app attack intelligence and defense control when **Frida Attach** is detected. To consume and use Threat-Events\u2122 for\nFrida Attach in iOS Apps, use AddObserverForName in Notification Center, and the code samples for Threat-Events\u2122 for Frida Attach shown below.\n\nThe specifications and options for Threat-Events\u2122 for Frida Attach are:\n\nThreat-Event\u2122 Elements | Detect Frida Attach Method Detail || Appdome Feature Name | Detect Frida Attach |\n| Threat-Event Mode | |\n| OFF, IN-APP DEFENSE | Appdome detects, defends and notifies user (standard OS dialog) using customizable messaging. |\n| ON, IN-APP DETECTION | Appdome detects the attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (app chooses how and when to enforce). |\n| ON, IN-APP DEFENSE | Uses Appdome Enforce mode for any attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (gather intel on attacks and threats without losing any protection). |\n| Certified Secure\u2122 Threat Event Check |  |\n| Visible in ThreatScope\u2122 |  |\n| Developer Parameters for Detecting Frida Attach Threat-Event\u2122 | |\n| Threat-Event **NAME** | FridaAttachDetected |\n| Threat-Event **DATA** | reasonData |\n| Threat-Event **CODE** | reasonCode |\n| Threat-Event **REF** | 7228 |\n| Threat-Event **SCORE** | || currentThreatEventScore | Current Threat-Event score |\n| threatEventsScore | Total Threat-events score |\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n\n  \n\nWith Threat-Events\u2122 enabled (turned ON), iOS developers can get detailed attack intelligence and granular defense control in iOS applications and create amazing user experiences for all mobile end users when Frida Attach is detected.\n\n  \n\nThe following is a code sample for native iOS apps, which uses all values in the specification above for Detect Frida Attach:\n\n  \n\n**Important!** Replace all placeholder instances of <Context Key> with the specific name of your threat event context key across all language examples. This is crucial to ensure your code functions correctly with the intended event data.\nFor example, The <Context Key> could be the message, externalID, OS Version, reason code, etc.\n\n

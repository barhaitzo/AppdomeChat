An.ipa file which is an iOS binary is essential for packaging and distributing iOS mobile apps, as it contains all the required components for the app to run successfully.  \nAll Appdome services can instantly be added to any iOS or Android app with no code or coding required.  \nWe hope you find this article helpful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## About .ipa files\n\niOS applications are bundled in a single file type called ipa (short for **i**OS \u00a0**P**ackage **A**pp Store).\n\nDespite their ipa suffix, these are just regular ZIP files and can be extracted if you modify the suffix to `zip`.  \nSince IPA files all have a well-defined internal structure, what you\u2019ll find inside is a single folder, inside of which will be another folder called `.app`. Besides the `Payload` folder, you may also find other folders and files, usually for the use of iTunes service.\n\nWhile on a Macintosh (Mac) computer, the app folder may look like a file. You can open it by right-clicking and selecting the command **Show Package Contents**.  \nInside, you\u2019ll find the following:\n\n* The `Info.plist` file  \n  This file describes the application to the iOS operating system using a list of properties. In the example shown in the figure below, one can see many properties such as:\n  1. Which files in the .ipa are the icon\n  2. Application display name\n  3. Version\n  4. Unique identifier\n  5. Application main executable filename  \n     ![structure of an .ipa](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image.png)\n\n* The application\u2019s main executable  \n  The main executable contains the code of the application. In essence, this *is* the application. All the Objective-C and Swift code punched in by your developers is encoded into this file. The executable\u2019s file name is determined by the `Info.plist`.  \n  The application file contains within it entitlement information, which is Apple\u2019s name for permissions.\n\n* External executable libraries  \n  Other libraries that the main executable uses.\n\n* `Frameworks`  \n  This is a folder that contains frameworks used by the application.  \n  Each framework resides under its own folder called `Frameworks/.framework` and contains its native code and resources.  \n  In addition, Swift applications have the Swift runtime libraries directly under the `Frameworks` folder.\n\n* Plugins  \n  The application executes application extensions.\n\n* Resources  \n  Documents, images, icons, video and audio files.\n\n* `www`  \n  If the application is a web app developed with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) or [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for example, the web data will be stored in a folder named `www`. It may contain web pages, resources, Javascript and CSS files, and so on.  \n  If such an application is fused with [TOTALCode obfuscation](/mobile-app-security/code-obfuscation/) enabled, these files (which contain the bulk of the application\u2019s intellectual property) would be encrypted.\n\n* [Nib](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/CocoaNibs/CocoaNibs.html)\u00a0or storyboard files  \n  These files describe the application\u2019s UI and how it interacts with its logic.\n\n* [Signature information](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/AboutCS/AboutCS.html)  \n  iOS verifies that all native code elements have not been modified since they were \u201csigned\u201d by the developer/distributor. This includes the executable, frameworks, libraries, PlugIns (app extensions), and WatchKit.  \n  The signing process [should follow a certain order](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/privately-sign-secured-shielded-ios-apps/): WatchKit, PlugIns, Frameworks (and the appdome Framework), Executable and `.app` folder.\n\n* Provisioning information (most commonly `embedded.mobileprovision`)  \n  This file determines the deployment permissions of the application. The short explanation is that as a developer, you can only install your application on a limited set of devices (so you won\u2019t distribute an application without Apple\u2019s approval). So, unless you published your application to the App Store (or acquired an enterprise code signature), you need to equip your application with a provisioning profile. The provisioning profile is also a plist file, and should be obtained by the developer from Apple\u2019s\u00a0[developer console](https://developer.apple.com/).  \n  The provisioning information contains inside it a copy of the application\u2019s entitlements, so as you may understand, you can\u2019t just give an application any permission you want; it must all be \u201cauthorized\u201d by Apple.\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nCheck out Appdome article on [.apk files](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/secure-android-apk-apps-without-coding/) or\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/) at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n---\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

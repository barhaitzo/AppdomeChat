Attackers may exploit techniques like VPNs, GPS spoofing, or SIM swapping to falsify location data, which can disrupt app functionality and cause legal or regulatory violations. These techniques allow bad actors to bypass geo-restrictions, engage in fraud, or compromise compliance with industry standards such as financial regulations (e.g., FFIEC) or data privacy laws like GDPR.\n\nEnsuring genuine location data is essential for maintaining app integrity and meeting compliance obligations.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Mobile Apps with Geo-Compliance?\n\n**Appdome\u2019s dynamic Geo-Compliance** plugin ensures that mobile apps maintain accurate and legitimate location data, actively preventing tampering, spoofing, and location manipulation attempts. It enables app developers to create security models based on geographic regions, restrict app use in non-compliant regions, and demonstrate adherence to country-specific regulations. Appdome\u2019s technology detects threats such as VPNs, GPS manipulation, and proxy use, automatically blocking or alerting based on the security models set by the development or compliance team. This automated protection simplifies compliance enforcement while ensuring the app\u2019s core functionality is secured against geographic location-based attacks.\n\n![Detect Fake Location Toggle](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Detect-Fake-Location-toggle-2.png)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[How to Protect Android & iOS Apps Against Fake GPS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/geo-compliance/detect-vpn-prevent-gps-spoofing/detect-fake-gps-app-on-android/)\n\n[How to Implement VPN Detection for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/geo-compliance/detect-vpn-prevent-gps-spoofing/vpn-detection/)\n\n[How to Detect Fake Location in iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/geo-compliance/detect-vpn-prevent-gps-spoofing/detect-gps-spoofing-in-ios-apps/)\n\n[How to Detect Fake Location in Android Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/geo-compliance/detect-vpn-prevent-gps-spoofing/detect-fake-location-in-android-apps/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1701345574327.1701603433188.252&__hssc=267077713.8.1701603433188&__hsfp=2089807795)!

On top of basic management and security services that enterprise mobility management (EMM) and mobile app management (MAM) vendors provide, these vendors also provide productivity apps in the hopes of reaching the digital workforce with a consistent user experience across all apps. For example, many EMM and MAM vendors also provide secure browsers, secure email and secure document sharing apps. The purposes of these apps is to make basic corporate uses from inside an EMM or MAM easier.\n\nThe challenge using EMM or MAM productivity apps and services is that \u201cother\u201d mobile apps don\u2019t come coded to work with, work only with, or consume these additional services out of the box. Likewise, EMM productivity apps often aren\u2019t part of the EMM or MAM vendor\u2019s SDK. Adding these services into \u201cother\u201d apps requires developers to re-write apps and create EMM-specific builds per EMM or MAM vendor.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions how to use secure browser and secure mail in enterprise apps by using Appdome\u2019s BoostEMM\u2122 to deliver improved enterprise mobility experiences across any Android and iOS mobile app in seconds.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Use Secure Browser, Secure Mail in Enterprise Apps\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there are no required infrastructure changes or EMM or MAM wrappers to configure. The interoperability of an app with the SDK policy, and the secure email/browser/document sharing services from the EMM vendor would ordinarily require a developer. The Appdome technology adds the secure email, secure browsers and secure document sharing features to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all. Using Appdome, mobile apps will use secure email, secure browsers and secure document sharing features as if they were natively coded to the app.\n\nBoostEMM\u2122 is an Appdome service designed to improve enterprise mobility experiences across mobile apps. It offers\u00a0 a way to connect additional services from the EMM vendor to apps, using Appdome\u2019s standard Mobile Integration Workflow.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome\u2019s BoostEMM\u2122\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s\u00a0BoostEMM\u2122\u00a0you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) \u2013 Android (.apk or .aab) or iOS (.ipa)\n* DLP policy that supports secure browser, email or document sharing.

Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps ).\n\n### Sign the BoostEMM\u2122 enabled Appdome-Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-Built app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/) and [Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the\u00a0Appdome-Built App\u00a0to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Built apps, please read [this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Connect Secure Browser in your app!\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nCheck out Appdome\u2019s BoostEMM\u2122 [press-release](https://www.appdome.com/press-release/appdome-boostemm-eases-mobile-app-integration/)\u00a0or\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

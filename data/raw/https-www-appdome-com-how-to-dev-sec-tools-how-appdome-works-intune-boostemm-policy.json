In addition to Microsoft Intune, Microsoft offers its customers a secure browser, Email, and document sharing capability. Unlike Microsoft mobile Apps, 3rd party Apps aren\u2019t pre-built to restrict the use of a browser, Email, and document sharing to Microsoft\u2019s secure apps by default. These capabilities are not coded inside non-Microsoft apps.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for using Appdome\u2019s BoostEMM\u2122 service to add the Microsoft secure browser, Secure Email, and document sharing into non-Microsoft mobile Apps in seconds.\n\n## What is Microsoft Secure Browser and Secure Email?\n\nAppdome\u2019s BoostEMM\u2122 service restricts apps to use Microsoft\u2019s Secure Email, Secure Browsers and secure document sharing to mobile Apps automatically. Your app will adhere to Intune\u2019s security policy as if the SDK was natively coded to the app.\n\nFurthermore, for iOS apps, Appdome also supports App Extensions, allowing the fused app to use the secured Microsoft apps services inline.\n\n## How to Add\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s Secure Browser, Email and Document Sharing Using Appdome\u2019s\u00a0BoostEMM\u2122\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s BoostEMM\u2122 service, follow these simple steps. Note, the same workflow can be used for either an Android or iOS App.\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features and 3rd party services and SDKs to Android and iOS apps without coding. \u00a0This KB shows mobile developers,\u00a0DevSec\u00a0and security professionals how to use\u00a0Appdome\u2019s simple \u2018click to build\u2019 user interface to quickly and easily.\u00a0\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nOnce you find the .ipa or .apk or .aab file you intend to use, simply select it. The file will be automatically added to the Appdome platform.\u00a0 Once complete, you\u2019ll see a success message and automatically moved to the next step in the workflow.v\n\n### Select BoostEMM\u2122\u00a0Features\n\nClick\u00a0**Management**\u00a0under the\u00a0**Build**\u00a0tab.\n\nThen, find\u00a0**EMM Services**\u00a0under the\u00a0**Enterprise Mobility Management**\u00a0heading.\n\n1. Enable or turn \u201cON\u201d\u00a0**EMM Services**and open the drop-down list.\n2. Next,\u00a0choose **Microsoft Intune SDK**\u00a0from the dropdown list.  \n   ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation8.png)\n3. Open the **BoostEMM\u2122****by Appdome** section and toggle \u201cON\u201d the relevant feature you would like to enable:\n   1. **Connect Secure Browser \u2013**Appdome\u2019s Connect Secure Browser causes a mobile App to open web links using the Microsoft Intune Browser only. This capability helps to secure your organization\u2019s data when the user opens links inside the App that are not accessible outside of the company\u2019s intranet. *Note: Before using this feature, m***ake sure Intune secure browser is installed on the device. Download it from the App store, and activate the\u00a0App\u00a0using the Intune login settings.**\n   2. **Connect Secure Email \u2013**Appdome\u2019s Connect Secure Email causes a mobile App to send emails using Intune Secure Mail Client only.\u00a0When the user selects an email link from your secure App, the secure email client will open allowing them to email to the selected address. *Note: Before using this feature, m***ake sure the Microsoft Outlook App is installed on the device. Download it from the App store, and activate the App using the Intune login settings.**\n   3. **Secure Document Sharing \u2013**Appdome\u2019s Secure Document Sharing causes a mobile App to restrict document sharing according to EMM policy. When selecting a file via your Intune-fused App, the file will be opened in an Acrobat for Intune secure App and will be shared via the Microsoft Outlook App only.\u00a0This will prevent opening and sharing your company files via external Apps. *Note: Before using this feature, m**ake**sure the Acrobat reader for Intune App is installed on the device. Download it from the App store, and activate the App using the Intune login settings.*\n4. Click **Build My App**\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/p3-1.png)\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each App and match the App to the relevant code-sets needed to add the Microsoft Intune SDK and the requested service to the mobile App in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0When your implementation is complete, you\u2019ll see the notice below. You now have a mobile App fully integrated with Intune SDK and will be able to use\u00a0Microsoft Secure Browser, Secure Email and secure document sharing as you requested.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Success.png)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no-code BoostEMM\u2122 service, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com) \u2013\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Microsoft Intune DLP configuration\n* You have a configured and accessible instance of Microsoft Intune (to deploy your App).\n\n## How to Activate the Intune Protection Policy on the Built App\n\nIn order to verify your built App can use\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s Secure Browser, Email and Document Sharing, you will need to activate Microsoft Intune Protection Policy on the App using the Intune portal.\n\n### Choose New/ Existing Intune Policy\n\n1.

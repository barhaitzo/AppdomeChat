For example: 4.14.2640.50501\n\nThe various components of the version number are as follows:\n\n1. **Platform**  \n   Appdome major version number. Any modification (increase) of this number reflects a significant change in the product, such as a newly available feature set.\n2. **OS**  \n   Indicates compatibility with a major version of the mobile OS, either iOS or Android.  \n   For example:  \n   4.16 \u2013 for iOS  \n   4.13 \u2013 for Android\n3. **Build**  \n   Indicates the branch. This number can have either of the following values:\n   * \u201c1\u201d:\u00a0The value \u201c1\u201d indicates a formal (master/release) branch, namely: Appdome\u2019s main product version. For example, 4.13.1.0001 for Android 13.\n   * Any other value:\u00a0All other versions get their own, unique version number. For example, if version\\_X and version\\_Y are developed simultaneously, all builds from version\\_X may get the number 443 and all builds from version\\_Y get the number 763.  \n     **Note**:\u00a0The build number is consistent and unique per version. In other words large numbers do not indicate newer builds; such progress is reflected in the Revision number (part 4).\n4. **Revision**  \n   A 5-digit number that indicates the most recent code change.  \n   The revision number changes further to any modification of the code.\n\n### Examples of Version Numbers\n\nThe examples below show version numbers from the various builds, assuming that the Appdome main product version is 4, iOS version is 14, and Android version is 11.\n\n* 4.16.1.43552 \u2013 An iOS build from master/release branch.\n* 4.13.763.43548 \u2013 An Android build from a certain side branch.\n* 4.13.763.43553 \u2013 An Android build from the same side branch as the one mentioned above.\n\n## Where is the Version Number Displayed\n\nThe Appdome Version number is displayed in the following locations:\n\n* **Fusion Set dropdown**  \n  If Appdome Version is frozen, the Appdome Version number is displayed when hovering the Freeze icon.  \n  ![Fs Dropdown 1a Version On Hover](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/FS-Dropdown-1a-version-on-hover.png)![Fs1 Dropdown Menu 2 Version On Hover](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/FS1-Dropdown-menu-2-version-on-hover.png)\n* **Fusion Set details**  \n  Upon enabling (toggling On) *Freeze Fusion Set*, the check box *Freeze Appdome Version* is displayed. As seen in the images below, the Appdome Version is displayed next to the check box, regardless of whether the check box is selected.  \n  ![03b Freeze Fusion Set Save Annotation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/03b-Freeze-Fusion-Set-Save-Annotation.png)  \n  ![04b Freeze Appdome Version [21]](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04b-Freeze-Appdome-Version-21.png)\n* **Appdome Certificate**The Appdome Version number is displayed in the certificate header.  \n  ![Certificate No Freeze V2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Certificate-No-freeze_v2.png)\n\n## Prerequisites to Use Appdome Protection on Android and iOS Apps\n\nIn order to protect your app by using Appdome, you need the following:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* A license to Appdome **Certified Secure**\u2122 (separate license required.

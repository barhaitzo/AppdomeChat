This Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for how to add proxy pac routing to enterprise mobile apps, instantly, without coding on Appdome.\n\n## How to Add Proxy PAC Routing to Enterprise Mobile Apps\n\nThe Appdome technology adds Proxy PAC support and relevant standards, frameworks and more to the app automatically, without any need for manual development.\u00a0Using Appdome, mobile apps will support proxy controlled by a PAC file as if it was natively coded to the app.\u00a0 Using Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement. Likewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on networking API inside the app.\n\nAppdome allows you to configure your app to proxy with dynamic and static configuration. Static configuration is constant per app and will require fusing the app with the new configuration and deploying it again to adapt to any changes in proxy network topology. A dynamic configuration can be achieved by setting a WPAD URL, which is a\u00a0path to a downloadable PAC file. The PAC file contains the proxy\u00a0translation logic between the protected host and the proxy that should route connections to that host. When multiple proxy setup methods are used the following priority will be used to determine the host-proxy translation logic. Appdome will first try and download the PAC file from the downloadable URL if omitted or downloading the file fails then static configurations will be used. Within static configuration, the Dedicated proxy URL will take priority over the PAC file.\n\nAdding support for Proxy PAC inside mobile apps does not require installing any VPN app or special configuration and doesn\u2019t impact any other app installed on the device. Furthermore, supporting proxy PAC works with [EMM tunneling](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/guarantee-android-ios-compatibility-uem-mam/) and [MicroVPN](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/achieve-secure-remote-mobile-app-access-microvpn/). These combinations will cover cases in which accessing a protected host requires a proxy, but the proxy itself is only accessible within the internal network.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome to add Proxy PAC inside Mobile Apps\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of Proxy PAC on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Appdome-Built App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/using-no-code-security-android-ios-apps/)\n* PAC file (see below)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\nA PAC file is a\u00a0text file\u00a0that defines at least one JavaScript function,\u00a0FindProxyForURL(url, host), with two arguments:\u00a0url\u00a0is the URL of the object and\u00a0host\u00a0is the host-name derived from that URL.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host) {\r\n\t// URLs from domains below example.com don't need a proxy\r\n\tif (shExpMatch(host, \"*.example.com\"))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn \"DIRECT\";\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// URLs within this network are accessed through\r\n\t// port 8080 on fastproxy.example.com:\r\n\tif (isInNet(host, \"10.0.0.0\", \"255.255.248.0\"))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn \"PROXY fastproxy.example.com:8080\";\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// All other requests go through port 8080 of proxy.example.com\r\n\treturn \"PROXY 203.0.113.0:8080\";\r\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the returned proxy can be:\n\n* DIRECT \u2013 no proxy is in effect\n* PROXY <IP:port> \u2013 proxy to the given IP and port\n* PROXY <host name:port> \u2013 proxy to the address resolved from the given host and port\n\nIf multiple options are given in a return statement, Appdome will only use the first.\n\nFor more information and examples regarding proxy.pac read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config).\n\n## The Easy Steps to Add Proxy PAC Routing to Enterprise Mobile Apps\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to customize Any Mobile App:\n\n**Upload a Mobile App to Your Account**\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\nSelect the\u00a0**Build Tab**.\u00a0*Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*Beneath the Build Tab, you will find several service options. Select **Access**.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n\n1. Open\u00a0**Appdome Access Suite**\n2. Open the sub-category **Private Server Certificate and Authorities**\n3. Click on the toggle to enable\u00a0**Proxy Settings**\n4. Enter a WPAD URL to a downloadable PAC file\n5. Enter The dedicated Proxy URL\n6. Upload a PAC file.\n7. press **Build\u00a0My App**.\n\n![Upload PAC fiile](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation5-1.png)\n\nThe technology behind Add Context to My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to customize your mobile app in seconds. For example, the technology supporting PAC files downloaded from a remote server, work that ordinarily a developer would need to do.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0You now have a mobile app fully integrated with Proxy PAC.\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\n### After Adding Proxy PAC inside Mobile Apps on Appdome\n\n**Sign the Proxy PAC enabled Appdome-Built App**\n\nDeploying an Appdome-Built app requires signing this app first. [Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/) and [Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally by using your own signing methods.\n\n**Deploy the Appdome-Built App to a Mobile Device**\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can download to deploy it by using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Built apps, please read\u00a0[this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\nThat\u2019s it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome Proxy PAC in your app!\n\nRelated Articles\n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [How to Achieve Secure Remote Mobile App Access with MicroVPN](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-workplace-apps/mobile-enterprise-access-and-microvpn/achieve-secure-remote-mobile-app-access-with-microvpn/?__hstc=267077713.f7b44dd7e2a2333d92cd2e27bb6333a3.1683799662430.1704106752742.1704110967927.479&__hssc=267077713.18.1704110967927&__hsfp=1931022262)\n* [How to Use a Mobile App\u2019s User-Agent for Secure NAC](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-workplace-apps/mobile-enterprise-access-and-microvpn/use-a-mobile-apps-user-agent-for-secure-nac/)\n* [How to Validate SSO Configurations in Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-workplace-apps/enterprise-authentication-and-mobile-sso/validate-sso-configurations-in-mobile-apps/?__hstc=267077713.f7b44dd7e2a2333d92cd2e27bb6333a3.1683799662430.1704106752742.1704110967927.479&__hssc=267077713.18.1704110967927&__hsfp=1931022262)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\n[To zoom out on this topic, visit](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)[App Branding on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps/) [on our website.](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

This allows them to (1) ensure that mobile application workflows are aware of attacks and threats, (2) customize business logic and user experience based on the user\u2019s risk profile and/or each attack or threat presented, and (3) pass the threat data to other systems of record such as app servers, mobile fraud analysis systems, SIEMs, and other data collection points.\n\nThe purpose of Threat-Events is to enable Android and iOS applications to adapt and respond to mobile app attacks and threats in real-time. Using Threat-Events will ensure you keep users, data, and transactions safe.\n\n### Mobile Application Threat-Events vs. Threat-Scores\n\nAppdome Threat-Events can be used as a stand-alone implementation in Native Android Apps, or in combination with Threat-Scores. Threat-Events provide the mobile developer with the in-app notification of each attack or threat, as well as the metadata associated with the attack. Threat-Scores provide the mobile developer with the Threat-Event event score and the combined (aggregate) mobile end-user risk at the time of the notification.\n\n![Threat Events\u2122, In App Threat Intelligence In Native Ios Apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Threat-Events\u2122-In-App-Threat-Intelligence-in-Native-iOS-Apps.png)\n\nThe figure below shows where you can find Threat-Events and Threat-Scores for each of the runtime mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile antibot, and other protections available on Appdome:\n\nTo enable Threat-Events with any runtime protection, select the check box next to Threat-Events for that feature. Doing so will enable (turn ON) Threat-Events for that feature. To enable Threat-Scores for any runtime protection, click the up/down arrow associated with Threat-Scores to assign a specific score to each protection.  \nThreat-Scores must have a value greater than zero (0) and less than a thousand (1,000).\n\nThreat-Events and Threat-Scores can be used with or in place of server-based mobile anti-fraud solutions.\n\nPrerequisites for Using Threat-Events with Native Android Apps\n\n### Here\u2019s what you need to use Threat-Events with native Android apps:\n\n* Appdome account (If you do not yet have an account,\u00a0[create a free Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)).\n* Appdome account class \u2013 Appdome DEV or higher.\n* Mobile Application Source Code.\n* Signing Credentials (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile) \u2013 see [Signing Secure Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/).\n\n### Code Snippet Required for\u00a0Using Threat-Events with Native Android Apps\n\nBefore consuming Threat-Events or Threat-Scores in your Native Apps, confirm that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Threat-Events and/or Threat-Scores have been enabled ( turned ON) for the specific protection\n* You are using the correct identifiers for the Threat-Events for each protection.  \n  You can find the specific identifiers for each Threat-Event and Threat-Score in the knowledge base article associated with each protection.\n\nBelow is the code snippet required for using Threat-Events\u2122 and Threat-Scores\u2122 in Native Android Apps:\n\n```\nprivate BroadcastReceiver receiver;\r\nprivate Context context;\r\n// Explicitly state that the ThreatEvents BroadcastReceiver should not be exported\r\nprivate void registerReceiverWithFlags(IntentFilter intentFilter) {\r\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU) {\r\n        context.registerReceiver(receiver, intentFilter, Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED);\r\n    } else {\r\n        context.registerReceiver(receiver, intentFilter);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\npublic void init(Context context) {\r\n    this.context = context;\r\n    receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {\r\n            onEvent(intent);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    registerReceiverWithFlags(new IntentFilter(\"RootedDevice\"));\r\n}\r\n// This method should be called during the Activity.onPause() if the context used when calling the init() method is an Activity context\r\npublic void stop() {\r\n    context.unregisterReceiver(receiver);\r\n}\r\nprivate void onEvent(Intent intent) {\r\n    String action = intent.getAction();\r\n    switch (action) {\r\n        case \"RootedDevice\":\r\n            String defaultMessage = intent.getStringExtra(\"defaultMessage\");\r\n            String internalError = intent.getStringExtra(\"internalError\");\r\n            String timeStamp = intent.getStringExtra(\"timestamp\");\r\n            String deviceID = intent.getStringExtra(\"deviceID\");\r\n            String deviceModel = intent.getStringExtra(\"deviceModel\");\r\n            String osVersion = intent.getStringExtra(\"osVersion\");\r\n            String kernelInfo = intent.getStringExtra(\"kernelInfo\");\r\n            String deviceManufacturer = intent.getStringExtra(\"deviceManufacturer\");\r\n            String fusedAppToken = intent.getStringExtra(\"fusedAppToken\");\r\n            String carrierPlmn = intent.getStringExtra(\"carrierPlmn\");\r\n            String deviceBrand = intent.getStringExtra(\"deviceBrand\");\r\n            String deviceBoard = intent.getStringExtra(\"deviceBoard\");\r\n            String buildHost = intent.getStringExtra(\"buildHost\");\r\n            String buildUser = intent.getStringExtra(\"buildUser\");\r\n            String sdkVersion = intent.getStringExtra(\"sdkVersion\");\r\n            //\r\n            // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here\r\n            //\r\n            break;\r\n        // Add cases for other actions here...\r\n        default:\r\n            Log.e(\"Appdome ThreatEvent\", \"unknown event received \" + action);\r\n            break;\r\n    }; \r\n}\n```\n\n### Threat-Event Failsafe Enforcement\n\nFailsafe Enforcement provides app developers with the ability to manage when Appdome enforces specific detections. To utilize this feature, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Set the Threat Event of the selected feature to \u201c**In-App Detection**\u201d mode.\n2. Enable the\u00a0**Threat-Event Failsafe Enforcement**\u00a0option.\n\nOnce you have received the Threat Event and performed the necessary internal logic, you should post a notification named \u201cEnforceThreatEvent\u201d using Android\u2019s Broadcast API with the userInfo received from the Threat Event. Below is the code snippet required for using Threat Event in Failsafe Enforcement configuration, with the RootedDevice event as an example:\n\n```\nString action = intent.getAction();\r\nswitch (action) {\r\ncase ROOTED_DEVICE: // // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here, as seen above // // Notify Appdome to enforce the Threat Event after Threat Event is handled Intent\r\nnewIntent = new Intent(\"EnforceThreatEvent\");\r\nnewIntent.putExtras(intent.getExtras());\r\nnewIntent.setPackage(context.getPackageName());\r\ncontext.sendBroadcast(newIntent); }\n```\n\nTo learn more, please read\u00a0[Threat-Events in Android & iOS Apps Explained](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-android-ios-apps-explained/)\n\n### Special Considerations for Using Threat-Events with Native Android Apps\n\nNone.\n\n##### Compatibility with Android 14\n\nFollowing a security update introduced in Android 14 (API level 34), apps targeting Android 14 are required to explicitly specify whether a registered receiver should be exported to all other apps on the device. A SecurityException will be raised if a context-registered broadcast receiver is registered without passing either `Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` or `Context.RECEIVER_EXPORTED`. The receiver flags were introduced in Android 13 as part of\u00a0 \u201cSafer exporting of context-registered receivers\u201d, as seen here: [[https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/features#runtime-receivers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/features#runtime-receivers \"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/features#runtime-receivers\")]. Therefore when registering a broadcast receiver for Threat Events, the call to register a a context-registered\u00a0 BroadcastReceiver registration should include the `Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` receiver flag when the app targeting Android 13 and above in order to ensure that the receiver will only accept broadcasts sent from within the protected app. For additional details, please follow this Android guide: [[https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts#context-registered-receivers](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts#context-registered-receivers \"https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts#context-registered-receivers\")]\n\n### Meta-Data for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nBelow is the list of metadata that can be associated with each mobile application Threat-Event and Threat-Score in native Android apps.\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| carrierPlmn | PLMN of the device. Only available for Android devices. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| deviceBrand | Brand of the device |\n| deviceBoard | Board of the device |\n| buildUser | Build user |\n| buildHost | Build host |\n| sdkVersion | Sdk version |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n\nSome or all of the meta-data for each mobile application Threat-Event and Threat-Score can be consumed in Native Android Apps at the discretion of the mobile developer and used, in combination with other mobile application data, to adapt the business logic or user experience when one or more attacks or threats are present.\n\n### Using Conditional Enforcement for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nConditional Enforcement is an extension to Appdome\u2019s mobile application Threat-Event framework. By using conditional enforcement, developers can control when Appdome enforcement of each mobile application protection takes place or invoke backup, failsafe, and enforcement to any in-app enforcement used by the mobile developer.\n\n### Verifying Threat Events in Native Android Apps\n\nAfter you have implemented the required Threat-Event code in your native Android apps, you can confirm that your Threat-Event implementation(s) is properly recognized by the Appdome protections in the native Android apps. To do that, review the\u00a0Certified Secure\u2122\u00a0DevSecOps certificate for your build on Appdome.\n\nIn the Certified Secure DevSecOps certificate, the correct implementation of Threat-Events in your mobile application is seen below.\n\n![Root Detection Cert](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/root-detection-cert-1-389x731.png)\n\nWhen Threat-Events implementation appears to be missing in your mobile application, the following indication will be shown in the Certified Secure DevSecOps certificate:\n\n* ![Android Missing Threat Events Implementation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Android_Missing_Threat_Events_Implementation-650x130.png)\n\nFor information on how to view and/or retrieve the Certified Secure DevSecOps certification for your mobile application on Appdome, please\u00a0visit the knowledge base article [Using Certified Secure\u2122 Android & iOS Apps Build Certification in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/certified-secure-android-ios/using-certified-secure-android-ios-apps-build-certification-in-devops-cicd/).\n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Maui, Xamarin Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-xamarin-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Kotlin Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-kotlin-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Native iOS Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-native-ios-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in React Native Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-react-native-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Cordova Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-cordova-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Swift Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-swift-apps/)\n* [How To Implement Threat-Events in Java](https://appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/implementing-threat-events-in-code/)\n* [Implementing Threat Events \u2013 Best Practices](https://appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/implementing-threat-events-best-practices/)\n\n## How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1732533773850.1732543896795.336&__hssc=79098507.5.1732543896795&__hsfp=3435076530)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

Unlike traditional cyberattacks that rely on technical vulnerabilities, social engineering exploits human psychology, leveraging trust and social norms to breach security protocols indirectly. The risk associated with social engineering lies in its stealth and deception; it preys on human judgment, often making it harder to detect and prevent than conventional cyber threats.\n\n## Appdome\u2019s Approach to Combating Social Engineering\n\nTo combat the nuanced and evolving threats posed by social engineering, Appdome offers a comprehensive suite of protections designed to safeguard mobile applications from these insidious attacks. By integrating advanced security features, Appdome helps organizations protect their data and users from the detrimental effects of social engineering.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome\u2019s

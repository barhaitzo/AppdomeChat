Appdome\u2019s Build2Secure plugin for Atlassian Bamboo is an out-of-the-box Atlassian Bamboo CI/CD integration, making it easy for mobile developers to automate the building, signing, and certification of security, anti-fraud, and other protections in Android and iOS apps in Atlassian Bamboo CI/CD pipelines. No code and no SDKs are required.\n\nAppdome\u2019s Build2Secure plugin for Atlassian Bamboo aims to streamline and accelerate cyber and anti-fraud delivery in CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThe Build2Secure plugin for Atlassian Bamboo automates three crucial steps in quickly delivering more secure mobile applications to your users:\n\n(1) Building app-level protections into mobile apps.\n\n(2) Code-signing the protected mobile app.\n\n(3) Certifying the security of each protected mobile app.\n\nThe Appdome Build2Secure plugin for Atlassian Bamboo enables the delivery of **Certified Secure\u2122** mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile anti-bot, among other cyber defense updates to mobile apps via the [**Appdome Cyber Defense Automation Platform**](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-cicd-system/). Use this plugin as a stand-alone DevSecOps integration or in combination with other DevSecOps integrations in your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nFor more general information on Atlassian Bamboo, refer to the [**Atlassian Bamboo CI/CD documentation**](https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/bamboo-documentation-directory-23855144.html) available on the Atlassian website.\n\nHere are the step-by-step instructions on using the Appdome Build2Secure plugin for Atlassian Bamboo.\n\n## Prerequisites for Secure Android & iOS Apps in Bamboo CI/CD\n\n* + An\u00a0[**Appdome SRM account**](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-release-management/)\n  + [**Appdome API token**](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-and-resetting-your-api-token)\n  + [**Fusion-Set ID**](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-a-fusion-sets-id)\n  + Atlassian Bamboo data center  \n    If you don\u2019t have Atlassian Bamboo installed, refer to this [guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-installation-guide-289276785.html)\u00a0to set up your Bamboo CI/CD\n\n## Step 1: Getting Started with Build2Secure Plugin for Bamboo\n\nAtlassian Bamboo automates building and testing of code projects, supporting all major languages and project types. It combines [**continuous integration**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops#continuous-integration),\u00a0[**continuous delivery**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops#continuous-delivery), and\u00a0[**continuous testing**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops#continuous-testing)\u00a0to build, test, and deliver your code to any destination.\n\nThe Appdome Build2Secure plugin takes the unprotected application file (apk, aab or ipa), rebuilds the file, and signs it by using the On-Appdome platform, based on the selected fusion set and signature method. This task can be performed either as part of an existing plan or as a new plan where you must provide the application file as part of the input for this task.\n\n## Step 2: Installing the Build2Secure Plugin for Bamboo\n\n* Log into your Bamboo server with an admin account\n* Navigate to \u201cManage apps\u201d in the administration dropdown.\n\n![Navbar Manage Apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/navbar-manage-apps.png)\n\n* Search for and install the Appdome Bamboo plugin from the marketplace.\n\n## Step 3: Setting up your Bamboo CI/CD Project\n\n* If you already have a Bamboo project, skip to step 4.\n* If you don\u2019t have a Bamboo project, start by creating one: Click \u201cCreate\u201d in the top navigation bar, then select \u201cCreate project\u201d and complete the required fields.\n\n![Bamboo Create Project](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bamboo-Create-Project-1-650x113.png)\n\n![Create Porject Configurations](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/create-porject-configurations-650x264.png)\n\n* Click Save.\n\n## Step 4: Creating a Plan\n\n* If you already have a Bamboo plan, proceed to Step 5.\n* If you don\u2019t have a Bamboo plan, start by creating one:\n  + Click \u201cCreate\u201d in the navigation bar\n  + Select \u201cCreate plan\u201d from the dropdown menu.\n  + Configure the plan that you want to create.\n\n![Create Plan Dashboard](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/create-plan-dashboard-1-650x154.png)\n\n![Plan Config 1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/plan-config-1-571x366.png)\n\n* Optionally, you can link a repository to this plan.\n\n![Plan Config 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/plan-config-2-650x308.png)\n\n* You can choose to add tasks to your plan now or save the plan and add tasks at a later stage (refer to Step 5 for adding tasks).\n\n![Plan Config 3](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/plan-config-3-459x366.png)\n\n## Step 5: Adding Appdome\u2019s Build2Secure task to your plan\n\nNow that you have a plan for your Bamboo project, it\u2019s time to configure it and integrate Appdome Build2Secure.\n\nGo to the \u201cActions\u201d dropdown on your plan dashboard and select \u201cConfigure plan\u201d.\n\n![Plan Dashboard](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/plan-dashboard-650x166.png)\n\nAll plans are created with a default job, which we\u2019ll use for this example, but you can configure it in other jobs as you need.\n\n* Choose the job that you want to configure the plan for.\n\n![Plan Config Dashboard](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Plan-config-dashboard-650x191.png)\n\n* Add a task.\n\n![Add Task](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/add-task-650x202.png)\n\n* Search for \u201cAppdome\u201d and select the Build2Secure task.\n\n![Bamboo Appdomebuild@secure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bamboo-AppdomeBuild@Secure.png)\n\n## Step 6: Configuring Appdome\u2019s Build2Secure task\n\nConfigure all the required parameters for your build:\n\n![Build2secure Configurations](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/build2secure-configurations-446x366.png)\n\n**Global configurations:**  \nFor the basic configurations that you need for any app, see Appendix A\n\n**Signing configurations:**\n\nFor signing on Appdome (Android/iOS), see Appendix B.\n\nFor Private signing (Android/iOS), see Appendix C.\n\nFor Auto Dev signing (Android/iOS), see Appendix D.\n\n**Additional Options**\n\nRefer to Appendix E for additional options such as \u201cBuild with Logs\u201d, \u201cBuild to Test\u201d, etc.\n\nAn explanation of how to use Bamboo variables is explained in Appendix F.\n\n## Step 7: Defining an artifact to publish the outputs\n\nTo access the outputs from this task, it\u2019s necessary to publish them as an artifact.\n\nIn the job configuration, go to the artifacts tab and click \u201cCreate artifact\u201d\n\n![Bamboo Artifact Definitions](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bamboo-Artifact-Definitions-650x60.png)\n\n* A configuration pop-up will appear, where you will specify the artifact\u2019s location.\n* Set the artifacts default location to: \u201cappdome\\_outputs\u201d\n* Use the copy pattern \u201c\\*\\*/\\*\\*\u201d to retrieve all of the files.\n\n**Note:** If you changed the location using the Output Path described in Appendix E, put the same path here.\n\n![Bamboo Create Artifact](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bamboo-Create-Artifact-504x366.png)\n\n## Step 8: Run the plugin\n\nExecute the plugin manually by selecting \u201crun\u201d or set up different types of triggers for the plan, as outlined in the [Triggering builds guide.](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo0904/triggering-builds-1299917419.html)\n\n![Bamboo Run The Plugin](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bamboo-Run-the-plugin-650x66.png)\n\nAppendices A to F provide detailed examples and configurations for various aspects of the Build2Secure plugin.\n\n## Appendix A: Global Appdome Build2Secure Inputs example\n\n![Bamboo Appendix A](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bamboo-Appendix-A.png)\n\nAn unprotected app path can be either a path to a file located on the agent (mainly as an output from an earlier task) or a download link from the web.\n\n## Appendix B: Sign on Appdome Build2Secure Inputs example\n\n### **Android**\n\n![Bamboo Appendix B Android](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bamboo-Appendix-B-Android.png)\n\n### iOS\n\n![Bamboo Appendix B Ios](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bamboo-Appendix-B-iOS.png)\n\nBoth mobile provisioning and entitlements can be either a path to a file located on the agent (mainly as an output from an earlier task) or a download link from the web.\n\nFor multiple files, enter them comma separated, without spaces.\n\n## Appendix C: Private Signing Build2Secure Inputs example\n\n### Android\n\n![Bambooappendixc Android](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BambooAppendixC-Android-650x177.png)\n\n### **iOS**\n\n![Appendix C Ios](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Appendix-C-iOS-650x207.png)\n\nBoth mobile provisioning and entitlements can be either a path to a file located on the agent (mostly as an output from an earlier task) or a download link from the web.\n\nFor multiple files, enter them comma-separated, without spaces.\n\n## Appendix D: Auto Dev Signing Build2Secure Inputs example\n\n### Android\n\n![Appendix D Android](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Appendix-D-Android-650x174.png)\n\n### iOS\n\n![Appendix D Ios](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Appendix-D-iOS-650x209.png)\n\nBoth mobile provisioning and entitlements can be either a path to a file located on the agent (mainly as an output from an earlier task) or a download link from the web.\n\nFor multiple files, enter them comma-separated, without spaces.\n\n## Appendix E: Extra Build2Secure Optional Inputs Appendix E\n\n**Build With Logs:** Check to build your app with diagnostic logs.\n\n**Second Output:** Checking this will generate a universal .apk file in addition to the secure .aab app file.  \n**Note:** Not supported for Auto Dev signing.\n\n**Build To Test:** Select your preferred automated testing service to build the app in test-ready mode.\n\n**Output Path:** Change the path of Appdome\u2019s outputs relative to the agent\u2019s working directory.\n\n(default: appdome\\_outputs)\n\n**Output App Name:** Change the name of your output app (no extension) (default: Appdome\\_Secured\\_App)\n\n## Appendix F: Using Bamboo variables\n\nIn your plan configuration, navigate to the \u201cVariables\u201d tab and define the variables you need.  \nSome keywords can make your variable masked for protection (password/secret, etc.)\n\nTo use the variable, enter it in the input field like this: ${bamboo.myvariablename}.\n\n![Appendix F](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Appendix-F-650x136.png)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* [How to use Appdome\u2019s Validate-2Secure Plugin for

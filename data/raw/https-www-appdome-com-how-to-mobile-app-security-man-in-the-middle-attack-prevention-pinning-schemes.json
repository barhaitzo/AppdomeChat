This article describes the **Certificate Pinning** Schemes that can be configured on Appdome.\n\n## What Are Certificate Pinning Schemes?\n\nCertificate Pinning Schemes define how mobile apps validate SSL/TLS certificates to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks and ensure secure communication with trusted servers. Attackers may intercept encrypted traffic using fraudulent certificates, compromised Certificate Authorities (CAs), or malicious proxies to decrypt sensitive data. By implementing certificate pinning, apps verify server authenticity based on predefined certificates or cryptographic properties, blocking unauthorized or rogue connections. Without proper certificate pinning, apps remain vulnerable to network-based threats, increasing the risk of data interception, credential theft, and regulatory non-compliance in financial, healthcare, and enterprise applications.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Mobile Apps With Certificate Pinning Schemes\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic **Certificate Pinning Schemes** plugins enforce SSL/TLS certificate pinning in Android and iOS apps, securing app-to-server communications against MitM attacks. Using AI-driven automation, Appdome applies pinning without manual coding, SDKs, or server modifications. The plugins offers multiple pinning profiles to meet different security and operational requirements.\n\n**To select a pinning scheme:**\n\nRefer to the relevant section below (Security or Anti Bot tabs)\n\n### In the Security Tab:\n\n1. Go to the **Security** tab > **Secure Communication** section.\n2. Enable (toggle On)**Certificate Pinning**.\n3. Click **+Add Pinning Profile**.\n4. Next to \u201cPinning Scheme\u201d, select the relevant Scheme from the drop-down list.\n\n[![Security Certificate Pinning](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Security_Certificate_Pinning-1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Security_Certificate_Pinning-1.png)\n\n### In the Anti Bot Tab:\n\n1. Go to the **Anti Bot** tab > **MobileBOT\u2122 Defense**\u00a0section.\n2. Enable (toggle On) **Pin to Host**.\n3. Next to \u201cPinning Scheme\u201d, select the relevant Scheme from the drop-down list.\n\n[![Mitm Pin To Host](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MITM_Pin_To_Host.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MITM_Pin_To_Host.png)\n\n### **Certificate Pinning Profiles/Schemes**\n\nAppdome offers the following mutually exclusive pinning schemes (aka: pinning profiles) to implement Certificate Pinning in any iOS or Android app:\n\n* **Chain Evaluation** \u2013 verifies the chain of trust for the Root and Intermediate Certificates uploaded to Appdome. It ensures that only intermediate and leaf certificates trusted by the uploaded certificates are accepted, effectively locking the chain of trust. Any mismatch triggers a security event.\n* **Strict Evaluation** \u2013 evaluates the exact fingerprint of server certificate uploaded to Appdome against the certificate returned by the server. This is equivalent to Leaf certificate pinning. If the server returns a different certificate, the mismatch is a security event.\n* **Root Evaluation** \u2013 only evaluates that the root CA returned for the specified domain/host (FQDN) matches the Root CA Certificate uploaded to Appdome. Because the CA certificates are valid for 10+ years, this setup will not require updates when the leaf certificate or the intermediate certificates are renewed (i.e., the server can return an updated intermediate or leaf certificate without invoking a security event). By pinning against the root certificate only, any changes to the customer\u2019s intermediate or leaf certificates will work without having to update the app.\n* **Public Key Evaluation** \u2013 only evaluates the server\u2019s certificate public key to ensure complete continuity of service when the certificate is renewed if the new server certificate comes with the same public key.\n* **No Pinning** \u2013 certificate chains received for the specific domain will not be verified by Appdome. They will normally fall back to the OS\u2019s default verification process.\n\nAfter selecting a pinning scheme, **upload Root CA public certificate, certificate chain, or server pinned certificate as a file or ZIP (.cer, .crt, .pem, .der, .zip)**, enabling multiple certificates under the same pinning configuration and advance planning for certificate expirations while maintaining MitM protection during server rotation.\n\n### **Security Tab: Pinning Control**\n\nIn the Security tab, developers can further enhance SSL/TLS security with additional enforcement options:\n\n[![Pinning Control](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pinning_Control.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pinning_Control.png)\n\n* **[Enforce Certificate Roles](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/enforce-tls-certificate-roles-prevent-mitm-attacks-in-ios-apps/)**Enforce network connections to verify \u2018basicConstraints\u2019 extension in the certificate chain.\n* **[Enforce Strong RSA Signature](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/secure-mobile-app-sessions-ssl-certificate-hardening/?__hstc=27234274.a6717a67918c9f46522403bb29f1660f.1733646284445.1741778516789.1741781666407.206&__hssc=27234274.12.1741781666407&__hsfp=1092976895)**  \n  Enforce server certificate signatures to use a Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) key with a length of at least 2048 bits.\n* **[Enforce Strong ECC Signature](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/secure-mobile-app-sessions-ssl-certificate-hardening/?__hstc=27234274.a6717a67918c9f46522403bb29f1660f.1733646284445.1741778516789.1741781666407.206&__hssc=27234274.12.1741781666407&__hsfp=1092976895)**Enforce server certificate signatures to use Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) key with a size of at least 256 bits.\n* [**Enforce SHA256 Digest**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/secure-mobile-app-sessions-ssl-certificate-hardening/?__hstc=27234274.a6717a67918c9f46522403bb29f1660f.1733646284445.1741778516789.1741781666407.206&__hssc=27234274.12.1741781666407&__hsfp=1092976895)  \n  Enforce server certificate signatures to use at least a SHA256 certificate hashing algorithm.\n\nUnlike static implementations, Appdome\u2019s CI/CD-integrated approach continuously adapts to SSL/TLS security needs, allowing organizations to enforce enterprise-grade protections without disrupting app functionality.\n\n## Related articles:\n\n* [How to Block Mobile Bots with Client Certificates, Authenticate Legitimate Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/block-mobile-bots-with-client-certificates-authenticate-legitimate-mobile-apps/)\n* [How to Block Mobile Bots Using Session & Header Secrets](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/block-mobile-bots-using-session-header-secrets/)\n* [How to Encrypt Shared Preferences in Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/encrypt-shared-preferences-in-android-apps/)\n* [How to Connect to Trusted Mobile Hosts with URL Whitelisting on Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/connect-to-trusted-mobile-hosts-with-url-whitelisting/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

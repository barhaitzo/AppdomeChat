With this method, you can quickly create teams or invite new members with the right roles and entitlements instead of assigning them manually.\n\n### **About Adding Team Members From CSV**\n\nIn many organizations, team collaboration is crucial for project success. Appdome\u2019s platform facilitates this by allowing you to create teams within the workflow and assign specific \u201cright-to-use\u201d entitlements that define each member\u2019s role and responsibilities. These entitlements are essential for task-specific assignments within the Appdome workflow, ensuring that team members\u2019 capabilities are effectively utilized and responsibilities are clearly delineated.\n\n### Understanding Team Roles and Entitlements\n\nEntitlements serve as specific rights granted to team members to perform certain tasks within the Appdome workflow. These are set to ensure that every team member contributes to the project within the scope of their assigned roles. Adding members through a CSV file automates the process of assigning these roles and entitlements, significantly reducing manual setup time and potential errors.  \nTo learn more about entitlements, see [How to Set User Entitlements in Mobile App Security Projects](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appsec-release-team/set-user-entitlements-in-mobile-app-security-projects/).\n\n### **Prerequisites for using Appdome for****Adding Team Members From CSV**\n\nBefore you start, ensure that you have an Appdome account\u2014[IDEAL](https://appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/choosing-appdomes-ideal-account/) GO or Higher.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide: Adding Team Members From a CSV File\n\nTo add users to a team from a CSV file, prepare a CSV containing the following information for each user:\n\n1. **Email:** The email address of the new team member.\n2. **Role:** The role the new team member is supposed to receive. [Appdome for Teams](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-appsec-workspaces/create-teams-in-mobile-devsecops-build-system-to-accelerate-delivery/) offers two different roles.\n   * **Member:** A team participant with no permission to alter team settings.\n   * **Leader:** A team administrator who can change team details, manage members, and adjust permissions.\n3. **Entitlements:** List of permissions each team member will have, such as:\n   * + **Workspace**\n       - UPLOAD: Uploading an app\n       - BUILD: Enabling workflow actions by clicking on the Build button on UI or Make a Build API request\n       - BUILD\\_SECURITY: Using the Security tab\n       - BUILD\\_ANTI\\_FRAUD: Using the Anti-Fraud tab\n       - BUILD\\_GEO\\_COMPLIANCE: Using the Geo- Compliance tab\n       - BUILD\\_ANTI\\_BOT: Using the Anti-Bot tab\n       - BUILD\\_MOBILE\\_EDR: Using the EDR tab\n       - BUILD\\_ACCESS: Using the Access tab\n       - BUILD\\_AUTHENTICATION: Using the Authentication tab\n       - BUILD\\_MANAGEMENT: Using the Management tab\n       - BUILD\\_F5: [EOL]\n       - CONTEXT: Adding [Context](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps) to an app\n       - SIGN: [Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps) an app\n       - DEPLOY: [Deploying](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps) an app\n\n       **Fusion Set**\n\n       - EDIT\\_FUSION\\_SETS: Editing a Fusion Set\n       - CERTIFICATES\\_UPDATE:\n       - ACCEPT\\_FUSION\\_SETS: Approve Fusion Sets received from another team by using the option to [release security templates between teams](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appsec-release-team/release-mobile-app-security-templates-between-teams/).\n       - FREEZE\\_UNFREEZE\\_APPDOME\\_VERSION: Using the Fusion Set Summary screen to freeze and unfreeze the Appdome version\n       - FUSION\\_SET\\_VERSIONING: entitlement to create multiple fusion sets.\n       - ACCORDION\\_ANNOTATION: Add an edit annotation to each command section (accordion), such as OS Integrity.\n       - RELEASE\\_FUSION\\_SETS\\_INTO \u2013 Entitlement to release a Fusion Set to another team\n\n       **Monitoring**\n\n       - View ThreatScope \u2013 Access to view ThreatScope data for the team to which the user belongs.\n       - View Certified Secure \u2013 Access to download a certificate from the team to which the user belongs.\n\n       **Admin**\n\n       - DUPLICATE\\_TEAM \u2013 A \u201csuper-user\u201d entitlement to duplicate an existing team with all its configurations (e.g., members and Fusion sets)\n       - DELETE\\_APP/SDK\n       - COPY\\_FUSED\\_BUILDS\\_INTO: [Copying builds](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/share-secured-mobile-app-builds-between-teams) from one team to another\n       - DOWNLOAD\\_FILES\\_FROM\\_FUSION\\_SETS: Entitlement to download\u00a0Fusion Set files.\n\nIn the CSV file, each row corresponds to a new member, and each member should have all the types of values explained above. The data in each row in the CSV should be structured as follows:\n\n![CSV add members](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/team-members-example__1_.png)\n\nFor your CSV to be in the right format, ensure that the following conditions are met:\n\n1. Email, role, and entitlements are in separate columns\n2. **Leader** and **Member** are written like this, with the first letter written in upper-case.\n3. Entitlements are written like in the list above, all uppercase and underscore separating the words.\n4. Entitlements are separated by a pipe (\u201c|\u201d)\n\nDownload here a\u00a0[CSV example file](https://appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/team-members-example.csv).\n\n### **Create a Team with Roles and Entitlements from CSV**\n\n**To create a team from a CSV file**:\n\n1.

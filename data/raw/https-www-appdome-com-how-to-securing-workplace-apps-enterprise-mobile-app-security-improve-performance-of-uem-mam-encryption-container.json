There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there is no requirement to implement TOTALData\u2122Encryption or to control the sandbox for all the files and temporary files the application writes during runtime for developing Dynamic Container Management capabilities for Android or iOS apps. Using Appdome, mobile apps will have Dynamic Container Management capabilities as if they were natively coded into the app.\n\n### Overview\n\nAppdome will add Dynamic Container Management to EMM SDKs to enhance security and optimizes performance for apps Built with an EMM SDK.\n\nAppdome Dynamic Container Management is a set of file system encryption and obfuscation techniques that encrypt all the files created after the EMM is done provisioning, using keys dependent\u00a0on the EMM secret tokens.\n\nThis feature encrypts and containerizes all the app files, including the ones that operating systems or external libraries, are writing into the sandbox and SD-card without and any performance impact.\n\nAppdome users AES-CTR 256 bit encryption method which is faster when accessing partial files (i.e. when reading a buffer from a file or mapping a part of a file into memory), vs the standard AES-CBC which most Third-party SDKs and encryption libraries used (that force decrypt the whole file even when trying to read a small block within it).\n\nAppdome users can also secure their apps and use the AES256 military-grade with [FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard\u00a0 Publication 140-2\u00a0) protocol.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/encrypt-android-ios-data-fips-140-2/)\n\nWe use the same advanced encryption method as the TOTALData\u2122Encryption option that is available with the Appdome Security Suite. The only difference is that instead of using an Appdome generated key, when you add Dynamic Container Management to EMM SDKs, Appdome uses a key that has been generated based on a secret token that is retrieved from the EMM management server.\n\nUsing Appdome, mobile apps Data will Encrypt your apps data as if Both Appdome\u2019s and the EMM encryption methods were natively coded to the app. Appdome for Dynamic Container Management is compatible with mobile apps built in any development environment including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps and non-native apps built in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic and more. This streamlines implementations, cuts development work, and ensures a guaranteed and consistent integration of Dynamic Container Management to any mobile app.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome Dynamic Filesystem Encryption\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of Dynamic container Encryption on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Active EMM Account\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## 5 Easy Steps to Improve Performance of UEM MAM Encryption Container\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add Dynamic Container Management to Any Mobile App:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to [add a mobile apps to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)\n\n**Adding an EMM service to your app from the**\u00a0**Build****tab**\n\nSelect the **Build****Tab**. *Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*Beneath the Build Tab, you will find several service options. Select **Management**.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n\n1. Slide the lever to the right to enable an EMM service, choose the desired EMM service.\n2. Under [**Appdome Mobility Suite**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/guarantee-android-ios-compatibility-uem-mam/) toggle the Dynamic Container Management button to the right.\n3. If there are certain files or directories you want to be left unencrypted, you can add them under \u201cExclude the following files\u201d\n4. Continue adding desired [Appdome Mobility Suite](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/guarantee-android-ios-compatibility-uem-mam/) features, or other features like [BoostEMM](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/boostemm-by-appdome/), [ONEShiled](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/fusing-apps-with-oneshield-by-appdome/) or [FIPS 140-2 compliance](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-data-encryption/encrypt-android-ios-data-fips-140-2/).\n5. When you are done, Click **Build\u00a0My App**\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Appdome_EMM_dynamic_container.png)\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) A microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integration, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to add an EMM SDK to the mobile app in seconds. For example, the technology of Dynamic Filesystem Encryption, work that ordinarily, a developer would need to do.\n\n**Congratulations!** You now have a mobile app fully integrated with Appdome\u2019s Dynamic Container Management.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Appdome_Build_Success-1111x731.png)\n\n## After Adding Dynamic Container Management to a Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAfter you have added Dynamic Container Management to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome Built App\n\nAppdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps ).\n\n### Sign the Dynamic Container Management enabled Appdome Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome Built app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/) and [Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the\u00a0Appdome Built App\u00a0to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome Built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome Built apps, please read [this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome\u2019s Dynamic Filesystem Encryption in your app!\n\n### **How Do I Learn More?**\n\nFor more information on [Appdome for\u00a0BlackBerry Dynamics please visit this resource](/enterprise-mobile-apps/enterprise-mobility/blackberry-dynamics/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\nTo zoom out on this topic, visit \u00a0Appdome for [Enterprise Mobility](/enterprise-mobile-apps/uem-mam-sdks/enterprise-mobility/) on our website.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com)!

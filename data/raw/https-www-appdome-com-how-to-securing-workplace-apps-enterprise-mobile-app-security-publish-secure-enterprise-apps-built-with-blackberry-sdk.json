Once you Deploy Mobile Apps integrated with BlackBerry to BlackBerry UEM, they can be deployed selectively and managed with MobileIron\u2019s policies. This Knowledge Base article covers the steps to publish secure enterprise apps built with BlackBerry SDK.\n\n### Deploy Mobile Apps integrated with BlackBerry SDK to BlackBerry UEM\n\nThe following pre-requisite tasks need to be completed prior to distributing your app with\u00a0BlackBerry UEM.\n\n* Your mobile app is[fused](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/make-android-ios-apps-work-blackberry-dynamics/)\u00a0with the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK.\n* Your mobile app is\u00a0[signed](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps).\n* You have a configured and accessible instance of BlackBerry UEM.\n\n## The Easy Steps to Publish Secure Enterprise Apps Built with BlackBerry SDK\n\n### Upload Your Fused app to BlackBerry UEM\n\n#### Create a\u00a0BlackBerry Dynamics App Entitlement\n\nTo upload an app to BlackBerry UEM, you must first create a\u00a0BlackBerry Dynamics App Entitlement. This is a BlackBerry app object that handles binary app files, policy and configurations, and user assignment. In the next step, you will upload the fused app into the app entitlement object.\n\n1.\u00a0Navigate to **BlackBerry UEM**within your web browser and Log in.\n\n2. Click\u00a0**Apps**.\n\n3. Click the \u201c**Add an App**\u201d button.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_Entitlement_1-768x349.png)\n\n4. On the selection window. Click **Internal BlackBerry Dynamics app entitlement**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_Entitlement_2-768x445.png)\n\n5. Enter the\u00a0app\u2019s\u00a0**Name**.\n\n6. Enter **Entitlement ID** and **Entitlement Version**. These must match the ID and version you used during fusion.\n\n7. You can add a **Description**.\n\n8. Click **Add**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_Entitlement_3-768x668.png)\n\n#### Upload the App into the App Entitlement\n\nAfter creating the app entitlement, the app window will appear.\n\n1. Click **iOS** or **Android** tab (according to the relevant app\u2019s platform). One entitlement can have both an iOS binary and an Android binary connected to it.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_uploadApp_1-768x478.png)\n\n2. Under App source file, click **Add**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_uploadApp_2-768x477.png)\n\n3. In the opened window, click **Browse** and locate the fused app.\n\n4. Click **Add**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_uploadApp_3-768x327.png)\n\n5. **Wait** for the upload to complete.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_uploadApp_4.png)\n\n6. You can Add app details like Vendor, Category, and Screenshots.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_uploadApp_5-768x431.png)\n\n7. You can control device support, installation type etc.\n\n8. Click **Save**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_uploadApp_6-768x369.png)\n\nThat\u2019s it! Your app is now uploaded to BlackBerry UEM. Next step is to assign the app entitlement to users or Groups.\n\n### Assigning the App to Users or Groups\n\n#### Assigning an App Entitlement to a User\n\n1. Click A. **Users** \u2013> B. **All Users**.\n\n2. Click the **User** you want to assign the app to.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToUser_1-768x246.png)\n\n3. Open **Apps**\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToUser_21-768x549.png)\n\n4. Click the \u2018**+**\u2018 button.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToUser_3-768x275.png)\n\n5. **Search** for the app entitlements\u2019s name.\n\n6. **Check** the checkbox next to the app entitlement (you can select multiple apps).\n\n7. Click **Next**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToUser_4-768x329.png)\n\n8. Select **Disposition** (Optional, Required or Denied installation). If App configurations are available to the app you can select an **App configuration** to be assigned to the user.\n\n9. Click **Assign**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToUser_5-768x306.png)\n\nThe app is now assigned to the user.\n\n#### Assigning an App Entitlement to a User Group\n\nTo assign the app entitlement to a user group:\n\n1. Click **Groups**.\n\n2. Click\u00a0**User**.\n\n3. Click the **Group name** you want to assign the app to.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToGroup_1-768x230.png)\n\n4. Click the \u2018**+**\u2018 button on the **Assigned apps** table.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToGroup_2-768x264.png)\n\n5. **Search** for the app entitlements\u2019s name.\n\n6. **Check** the checkbox next to the app entitlement (you can select multiple apps).\n\n7. Click **Next**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToUser_4-768x329.png)\n\n8. Select **Disposition** (Optional, Required or Denied installation). If App configurations are available to the app you can select an **App configuration** to be assigned to the user.\n\n9. Click **Assign**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignToUser_5-768x306.png)\n\nThe app is now assigned to the user group.\n\n### Create and Manage BlackBerry Dynamics Security Profile\n\nA BlackBerry Dynamic Profile manages the SDK\u2019s security features and can be assigned to users and user groups.\n\n#### Create a BlackBerry Dynamic profile\n\n1. Click **Policies and Profile**.\n\n2. Under Policy, click **BlackBerry Dynamic**.\n\n3. Click the \u2018**+**\u2018 button.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_createProfile_1-768x328.png)\n\n4. **Name** the Policy.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_createProfile_2-768x331.png)\n\n5. You can use the policy to configure security features such as:\n\n1. **Password**: The type and setting of the password protecting apps governed by the profile.\n2. **Lock screen**: Control when and how to lock the app.\n3. **Data leakage prevention**: Control the limitations on data usage for the app.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_createProfile_3-768x940.png)![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_createProfile_4-768x417.png)\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_createProfile_5-768x294.png)\n\n6. Once you are done configuring the Profile, click **Add**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_createProfile_6-768x308.png)\n\n#### Assign the Profile to a User or User Group\n\n1. Go to the User or User Group you want to assign the profile to, like before (See assigning an app to users or groups above)\n\n2. Click the \u2018**+**\u2018 button in the Assigned profile table.\n\n3. Click **BlackBerry Dynamic**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignProfile_1_1-768x315.png)\n\n4. **Select** the Profile from the drop-down menu\n\n5. Click **Assign**.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UEM_assignProfile_2-768x416.png)\n\nThe Profile is now assigned to the user or the user group. It will govern apps fused with the BlackBerry Dynamic SDK assigned to the users and installed on the device.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

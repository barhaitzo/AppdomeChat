When an app is secured using Appdome, the original signature is invalidated during the Build process, and the app must be re-signed before deployment. This Knowledge Base explains how to sign secured Android apps **directly on Appdome**, without using Android Studio.\n\n## Why Sign Secured Android Apps Without Android Studio on Appdome\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile security platform enables developers, DevSecOps teams, and security professionals to secure and sign Android apps without SDKs or code changes. After an app is built on Appdome, it can be signed using Appdome\u2019s built-in signing workflow or through private signing methods, depending on deployment requirements.\n\nSigning on Appdome supports all Android app types, including native Android apps, hybrid apps, and non-native apps built using frameworks such as MAUI, Xamarin, Cordova, React Native, Ionic, and more. This provides a simple and consistent way to prepare secured Android apps for deployment across production, testing, and enterprise distribution workflows while maintaining full compatibility with Appdome\u2019s runtime protections.\n\n## Trusted Signing Certificates\n\nAppdome uses a **Trusted Signing** model to validate signing integrity based on authorized certificate fingerprints, rather than distribution-specific signing behavior. Customers explicitly define which signing certificates are trusted, and any app signed with one of these certificates is considered valid and will not trigger anti-tampering protections.\n\nThis unified model replaces previous toggle-based signing behavior and enables consistent signing across production, testing, and enterprise distribution workflows.\n\n### Prerequisites for Signing Secured Android Apps Without Android Studio\n\nIn order to sign your Android app, you\u2019ll need a valid signing certificate stored in the Android development environment.\u00a0 To use your certificate, you\u2019ll need access to the following.\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* Appdome built mobile app.\n* Keystore \u2013 This should be the same keystore file used to sign your Android app when distributing it via Google Play.\n* Keystore Password \u2013 The password used to unlock your keystore.\n* Key Alias \u2013 The name you assigned to your keystore.\n* Key Password \u2013 This is the specific password defined for your signing key.\n\nFor more information and a detailed manual on how to create Signing Credentials, please read [this knowledge base article](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key).\n\nTo learn more about the different signing options for secured Android apps, please read [How to Sign your Android App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-android-apps-using-apksigner/).\n\n## Easy Steps to Sign Secured Android Apps Without Android Studio\n\nPlease follow these step-by-step instructions on how to sign Android apps without Android Studio.\n\nNavigate to the **Sign** tab of the Appdome workflow and follow these steps:\n\n1. Select and APK/AAB app you\u2019d like to sign (the app needs to complete the Build process with Appdome for you to be able to sign it)\n2. In the upper navigation bar, select\u00a0**Sign**.\n3. Next to \u201cHow Would You Like to Sign?\u201d, select\u00a0**On Appdome**.\n4. Under **Trusted Signing Certificates**, add a **SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint**.\n   * This is **required** when the app will be re-signed by another signing authority (for example, Google Play).\n   * For more information, see [the following Appdome knowledge base article.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-app-with-sha-fingerprint-google-cert-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n5. (Optional) Add an **Annotation** to document certificate usage.\n6. (Optional) Select the **Trusted Store Signing** checkbox, if instructed by Appdome Support.\n7. Select **Sign My App**.\n8. (Optional) In the pop-up message, select **OK** to save your signing credentials, or **Skip** to proceed without saving.\n9. (Optional) In the pop-up message, select\u00a0**OK**\u00a0to save your signing credentials. Otherwise, select\u00a0**Skip**. You can remove the credentials at any time by clicking\u00a0**Remove Signing Credentials**.\n\n[![Android Sign On Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome.png)\n\n(Optional) Under\u00a0**Trusted Signing Certificates**, click\u00a0**+**\u00a0to add a\u00a0**SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint:**\n\n[![Android Sign On Appdome W Sha1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome_W_SHA1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome_W_SHA1.png)\n\n\u2026\n\n**Optional: Save or Remove Signing Credentials**  \nAppdome allows saving signing credentials to streamline future signing processes.  \nAdditionally, if the signing credentials are no longer needed or need to be updated, they can be removed directly from the **Sign Tab** by clicking the **Remove Signing Credentials** button.\n\n[![Android Sign Save Details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_Save_Details.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_Save_Details.png)\n\nWhen you click\u00a0**Sign My App,** Appdome analyzes the fused app\u2019s components and calculates a checksum that represents the exact state of each component within the app. Embedding the checksum combined with your signing credentials into the app\u2019s components will ensure that the app can\u2019t be modified or tampered with once the signing is complete.\n\nTo learn more about Appdome\u2019s Checksum Validation, see our [Running a Checksum Validation of Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-and-app-shielding/running-a-checksum-validation-of-android-and-ios-apps/)\u00a0knowledge base article.\u00a0\n\n**Congratulations!**\n\nYou\u2019ve now signed your Appdome Fused app, and it\u2019s ready to deploy.\n\n[![Android Signing Completed](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Signing_Completed.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Signing_Completed.png)\n\n## After Securing Android Apps Without Android Studio on Appdome\n\n### Deploy the Appdome Built App to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome Built app, you can download it and deploy it using your distribution method of choice.

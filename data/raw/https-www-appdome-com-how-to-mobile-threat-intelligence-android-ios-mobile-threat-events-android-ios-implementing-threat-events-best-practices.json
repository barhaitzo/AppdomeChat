This mechanism is the simplest Android communication system to implement.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article specifies two common issues with the implementation of threat events:\n\n* The Threat-Event BroadcastReceiver is registered in an activity context\n* The Threat-Event is handled on the UI thread\n\n## The Threat-Event\u00a0BroadcastReceiver is Registered in an Activity Context\n\n### Issue\n\nThe Threat-Event BroadcastReceiver is registered in an activity context, which is only valid as long as the activity (login screen, introduction screen and so on) is displayed in the UI. As a result, the BroadcastReceiver needs to be registered and deregistered in each activity.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nMove the Threat-Event BroadcastReceiver registration to the app\u2019s application class.\n\nThis operation has the following advantages:\n\n* The BroadcastReceiver is registered in an Application context, which is valid throughout the entire lifecycle of the app, without any need for de-registration.\n* Registering the BroadcastReceiver only once means the developer can use a singleton to initiate the receiver class and access the singleton to query which Threat-Events have been sent to the app.\n\n## Threat-Event is Handled on the UI Thread\n\n### Issue\n\nThe Threat-Event is handled on the UI thread that is also used for sending the broadcast to the BroadcastReceiver. Therefore, while the Threat-Event is being parsed, the end-user may experience an unresponsive UI when performing user gestures such as tap or key events.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nEnsure that the UI thread only handles UI operations such as displaying a toast or a dialog, while Threat-Event parsing is performed in a side thread.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Kotlin Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-kotlin-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Native iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-native-ios-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in React Native Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-react-native-apps/)\n* [How To Implement Threat-Events in Java](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/implementing-threat-events-in-code/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Cordova Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-cordova-apps/)\n* [Implementing Threat Events \u2013 Best Practices](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/implementing-threat-events-best-practices/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Native Android Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-native-android-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Maui, Xamarin Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-xamarin-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Swift Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-swift-apps/)\n\n## How to Learn More\n\nIf you want to learn how to troubleshoot common issues with the implementation of Threat-Event, check out the KB article [Implementing \u00a0Threat Events \u2013 Best Practices](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-threat-intelligence-android-ios/mobile-threat-events-android-ios/implementing-threat-events-best-practices/)**.**\n\nIf you want to use Threat-Events to respond to threats detected by Appdome [ONEShield,](/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) check out this KB article on [ONEShield Threat-Events](/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-implement-appdomes-oneshield-threat-events/).\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\nOr\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

As a result, the app\u2019s original signature is invalidated and must be re-signed to allow deploying the app on mobile devices.\n\nAppdome allows signing an app via the\u00a0**Sign**\u00a0tab, by using any of the following methods:\n\n* **On Appdome**\n\nAllowing Appdome to take care of the entire signing process. You only need to provide the signing credentials. For details, see topic [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode).\n\n* **Private Signing**\n\nGives you full responsibility for handling the entire signing process. For details, see topic\u00a0[How to Privately Code Sign Sealed iOS Apps using DevSecOps Build System](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/privately-code-sign-sealed-ios-apps-using-devsecops-build-system).\n\n* **Auto-DEV Private Signing**\n\nAllows you to sign the app without uploading the signing certificate to Appdome\u2019s cloud service.  \nAppdome provides you with a script (.sh file), which runs on your\u00a0trusted environment and signs\u00a0the app by\u00a0using your credentials (certificate and password) as input. For details, see topic [How to Automate Secure iOS App Code Signing in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/automate-secure-ios-app-code-signing-in-devops-cicd/).\n\nAs part of the Appdome signing process of secured iOS apps, by using either Auto-dev Private Signing or Signing on Appdome, you are required to extract and upload a [*Provisioning Profile*](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appdome/knowledge-base/ios-entitlements-files) and an [*entitlement*](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/extract-and-use-ios-entitlements-files-for-signing-secured-ios-app/) file *for each executable* in the app, and when using signing on Appdome, a *P12 certificate and its password*.\n\nThis article provides instructions for\u00a0generating the P12 distribution certificate and for using it via Appdome.\n\n**What is** **a** **P12** **file****?**\n\nA distribution certificate identifies your team/organization within a distribution provisioning profile and allows you to submit your app to the Apple App Store.\n\nA .p12 file contains the certificates that Apple needs in order to build and publish apps.\n\nThe steps below guide you through the process of creating an iOS Distribution Certificate and .p12 file. To learn more about certificates and how they work in Apple\u2019s App Store, you are advised to [visit the iOS Dev Center](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/) and consult the official Apple documentation.\n\n**Note**:\n\nIf you already have an apple certificate, go to section *Downloading the Certificate Signing Request* from your Apple Developer Account (developer.apple.com).\n\n## Creating a New Certificate Signing Request for Development\n\n**Notice:** The steps below require a Mac computer.\n\n**To create a new certificate signing request**:\n\n1. Open Keychain Access.\n2. Go to **Keychain Access** > **Certificate Assistant** > **Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority**.  \n   ![Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority in the Keychain Access](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-17.24.23-1-650x301.png)\n3. Enter your information: Email Address and Certificate Common Name.  \n   **Note**: The Certificate Authority email address is not needed if you are saving the certificate signing request to disk.  \n   ![Certificate information](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-17.25.40-516x366.png)\n4. Select the *Saved to Disk* option and click **Continue**.\n5. Select the directory on your Mac computer in which you would like to store the certificate signing request file. Alternatively, accept the default directory. When done, click \u00a0**Save**.  \n   ![Save the certificate signing request file](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-17.30.32-650x265.png)\n6. Go back to Apple developer webpage.  \n   To generate your certificate, you need to import the certificate signing request.\n7. Click **Continue**.  \n   ![Create a new certificate](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-17.32.48-650x205.png)\n\n## Downloading the Certificate Signing Request from Your Apple Developer Account\n\nNow that Your certificate is ready, download and activate it by running the following steps:\n\n1. Click\u00a0**Download** to download the certificate to your Mac.\n2. Give the certificate a name with a\u00a0**.cer** extension.\n3. Save the certificate file to a location of your choice on your Mac computer.  \n   ![Save the certificate file on a Mac computer](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-18.05.46-650x297.png)\n4. Locate the certificate in the finder and double-click the certificate file name to add to Keychain Access on your Mac computer.  \n   This step is required to allow you to create a P12 file from Keychain Access.  \n   ![Create a P12 file from Keychain Access](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-18.20.53-650x222.png)\n5. Open **Keychain Access** on your Macintosh computer.\n6. From the left navigation panel, under **Category**, select **Certificates**.\n7. In the search bar, type: *distribution*.\n8. Locate your new certificate and expand it by clicking the triangle icon to the left of the certificate name.  \n   After expanding, you should see a private key under the distribution certificate.  \n   ![Private Key Number](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-18.23.50-650x240.png)\n9. Right-click the distribution certificate and click\u00a0**Export iPhone Distribution**to create a P12 certificate file containing the distribution certificate and the private key.\n10. Give the P12 certificate file a name.\n11. Specify a location where the file is to be saved and then click **Save**.  \n    This P12 certificate will be used for signing apps on the Appdome platform.  \n    ![P12 certificate used for signing apps on Appdome platform](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-18.30.40-650x254.png)\n12. After saving, you will be prompted to enter a password to protect the P12 certificate file**.**\n13. Click **OK** after entering and verifying your password.  \n    This is the password you must provide when signing your application (locally or on Appdome).  \n    Important: *Do not lose this password, as it is required for future iOS signing*.  \n    ![password required for future iOS signing](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-18.49.52-541x366.png)\n14. If prompted, click **Allow** to enable\u00a0Keychain Access to export the key from your keychain.  \n    ![Enabling\u00a0Keychain Access to export the key from your keychain](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-18.58.41-650x298.png)\n\nCongratulations! You now have a proper P12 certificate file. Now you can use it to sign your application via Appdome.\n\n## **Related Articles**\n\n* [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n* [How To Sign Secured Android Apps Without Android Studio](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/)\n* [signing apps with Extension or Frameworks](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-apple-watchkit-apps-without-xcode/).\n* [Request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, you are welcome to contact us at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\nWant a Demo?\n\nAutomated Signing of Secured Mobile Apps\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Appdome_Team_Photos_Tom_Tovar_BW.jpg)\n\nTomWe're here to help\n\n\n\n\nWe'll get back to you in 24 hours to schedule your demo.\n\n* [Home Page](https://www.appdome.com/)\n* [Dev+Sec Blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/)\n* [Request A Demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/appdome-home/)\n* [Platform](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-tool-cicd/)\n* [Pricing](https://www.appdome.com/appdome-pricing/)\n* [About](https://www.appdome.com/about/)\n* [Patents](https://www.appdome.com/legal/patents/)\n* [Knowledge Base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/)\n* [In The News](https://www.appdome.com/in-the-news/)\n* [Careers we\u2019re hiring!](https://www.appdome.com/about/work-at-appdome/)\n* [Terms Of Use](https://www.appdome.com/legal/terms-of-use/)\n* [Press Releases](https://www.appdome.com/press-releases/)\n* [Privacy Policy](https://www.appdome.com/legal/privacy-policy/)\n* [Contact Us](https://www.appdome.com/contact-us/)\n\n\n\n---\n\nREDWOOD CITY OFFICE\n\n* 3 Twin Dolphin Drive,   \n  Suite 375 Redwood City,   \n  CA 94065\n* Phone: [+1.650.567.6100](tel:+16505676100)   \n  Mobile: [+1.844.360.FUSE (3873)](tel:+1844360FUSE (3873))   \n  Email: [info@appdome.com](mailto:info@appdome.com)\n\nISRAEL OFFICE\n\n* 21 HaArba'a Street,\n* Phone: [+97235568332](tel:+97235568332)   \n  Email: [info@appdome.com](mailto:info@appdome.com)\n\nSearch for:\n\nFollow us\n\n\u00a92026 Appdome, Inc.

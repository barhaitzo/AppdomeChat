This approach ensures that security measures are in sync with the app\u2019s user consent process, thereby enhancing user trust and meeting privacy standards.\n\n## Why Use Conditional Evaluation?\n\n* + **User Privacy**: This policy respects user privacy by not initiating any security tests or validations until after user consent has been obtained.\n  + **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps ensure compliance with global privacy laws that require user consent before data processing or security checks.\n  + **Enhanced Trust**: Builds user trust by transparently aligning security measures with user consent, demonstrating a commitment to privacy.\n\n## Prerequisites for using Appdome Conditional Evaluation\n\n* + - [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 Appdome DEV or Higher.\n    - [Threat-Events license](https://www.appdome.com/appdome-pricing/)\n    - A license for **Conditional Evaluation**\n    - [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n    - **Signing Credentials** (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile) \u2013 see Signing Secure Android apps and Signing Secure iOS apps.\n    - Threat events and/or threat scores have been turned on for specific protection. You are using the correct identifiers for the Threat-Events for each protection.\n    - The \u201conConsentFinished\u201d implementation has been added to your app prior to upload.\n\n## Using Input Threat-Events\u2122 for Conditional Evaluation in Mobile Apps\n\nBefore enabling the Conditional Evaluation feature, ensure your app has been uploaded to the Appdome platform with the necessary input threat event, as shown in the following code example. This is crucial for the feature to function correctly.\n\n**Note:** Input Threat Events are unavailable for multi-platform frameworks such as React Native, Flutter, and Cordova. If you are using these coding languages, it is recommended that you build a bridge class that acts as an intermediary between the framework and the mobile native API.\n\nFor more details on how to build bridging classes for Flutter and Cordova, please refer to the following documentation: [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels) and\u00a0[Cordova Plugin Development Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/10.x/guide/hybrid/plugins/).\n\n### Java\n\n```\n// Define placeholders for key and value \r\nString key = \"<KEY_PLACEHOLDER>\";\r\n String value = \"<VALUE_PLACEHOLDER>\";\r\n // Create a new intent with the action \"ConditionalEvaluationEvent\" \r\nIntent intent = new Intent(\"ConditionalEvaluationEvent\"); \r\n// Create a bundle to hold the data \r\nBundle bundle = new Bundle(); \r\n// Add the key-value pair to the bundle \r\nbundle.putString(key, value); \r\n// Attach the bundle to the intent \r\nintent.putExtras(bundle); \r\n// Get the application's context \r\nContext context = getApplicationContext(); \r\n// Set the package name for the intent \r\nintent.setPackage(context.getPackageName()); \r\n// Send the broadcast with the intent \r\ncontext.sendBroadcast(intent);\n```\n\n### Kotlin\n\n```\nval key = \"KEY_PLACEHOLDER>\" \r\nval value = \"<VALUE_PLACEHOLDER>\" \r\nval intent = Intent(\"ConditionalEvaluationEvent\") \r\nval bundle = Bundle() \r\nbundle.putString(key, value) \r\nintent.putExtras(bundle) \r\nval context = applicationContext \r\nintent.`package` = context.packageName \r\n\r\n// Sending information back to Appdome \r\ncontext.sendBroadcast(intent)\n```\n\n#### Xamarin/MAUI Android \u2013 C#\n\n```\nstring key = \"<KEY_PLACEHOLDER>\";\r\nstring value = \"<VALUE_PLACEHOLDER>\"; \r\n// Create a new intent with the action \"ConditionalEvaluationEvent\" \r\nIntent intent = new Intent(\"ConditionalEvaluationEvent\"); \r\n// Create a bundle to hold the data \r\nBundle bundle = new Bundle(); \r\n\r\n// Add the key-value pair to the bundle \r\nbundle.PutString(key, value); \r\n// Attach the bundle to the intent \r\nintent.PutExtras(bundle); \r\n// Set the package name for the intent \r\nintent.SetPackage(ApplicationContext.PackageName); \r\n// Send the broadcast with the intent \r\nApplicationContext.SendBroadcast(intent);\n```\n\n### Objective-C\n\n```\nNSString *key = @; \r\nKEY_PLACEHOLDER > \";\r\nNSString *value = @\"\"; \r\nNSDictionary *userInfo = @{key : value}; \r\n// Sending information back to Appdome \r\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] \r\npostNotificationName:@\"ConditionalEvaluationEvent\" \r\nobject:nil \r\nuserInfo:userInfo];\n```\n\n### Swift\n\n```\nlet\u00a0key\u00a0= \"<KEY_PLACEHOLDER>\" \r\nlet value = \"<VALUE_PLACEHOLDER>\" \r\nlet userInfo = [key: value] \r\n\r\n // Sending information back to Appdome \r\n NotificationCenter.default.post( \r\n   name \r\n   : Notification.Name(\"ConditionalEvaluationEvent\"), object \r\n   : nil, userInfo \r\n   : userInfo)\n```\n\n### Xamarin/MAUI iOS -C#\n\n```\nString key = \"<KEY_PLACEHOLDER>\"; \r\nString value = \"<VALUE_PLACEHOLDER>\"; \r\n// Create a dictionary to hold the data \r\nNSDictionary userInfo = new NSDictionary(key, value); \r\n// Post a notification with the data \r\nNSNotificationCenter.DefaultCenter.PostNotificationName(\"ConditionalEvaluationEvent\", null, userInfo);\n```\n\n## How to Enable Conditional Evaluation\n\nThe figure below shows where you can find the Conditional Evaluation feature for each of the runtime mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile antibot, and other protections available on Appdome.\n\n**Note:** We have used Android MitM Prevention as an example; you can enable Conditional Evaluation for any feature that includes Threat Events.\n\nOn Appdome, follow these **3 simple steps** to create self-defending Android Apps that **Prevent Android MitM Attacks** without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1.

For example, they may want to only allow offline access after successful authentication with a remote server. They may also want to limit offline access to the data to a specific time frame or require additional authentication.\n\nWith Appdome [Data at Rest Encryption](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/mobile-app-data-encryption-explained/), all data stored inside the mobile app (including media files) is encrypted at run-time using industry-standard AES 256\u00a0 cryptographic protocols. When the Appdome **Smart Offline Handoff** option is enabled, Appdome decrypts the app\u2019s data only after the user successfully authenticates. Additionally, the developer can specify a folder for offline file access, along with the required conditions that must be met in order to permit offline access to the data\u00a0 (for example, the required conditions may include a time expiration or require additional authentication, such as Pincode/ biometric authentication).\n\nAdding Appdome Smart Offline Handoff to your app also requires Appdome input **Threat-Events \u2122** to be enabled in your code. The Threat-Events \u2122 will inform Appdome when and how to enable offline access to the app\u2019s files. Once the timeframe has expired, Appdome notifies the app via a Threat Event and re-encrypts the files.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome\u2019s Smart Offline Handoff\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u2013\u00a0[IDEAL](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/choosing-appdomes-ideal-account/)\u00a0or higher.\n* [Appdome-DEV access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n### Appdome Threat-Events \u2122 Structure\n\nEach Appdome Threat-Event\u2122 is a set of key/value dictionaries. Both key and value are strings: Java Strings for Android App and NSString for iOS Apps.\n\n| EventID | **Event Fields** |\n| --- | --- |\n| OfflineFolderAccessed | * timestamp \u2013 the UNIX epoch timestamp of the event * action \u2013 which action took place:   + expired \u2013 offline key has expired   + noSecret \u2013 The user tried to access a file in the offline folder without providing an offline secret   + accessNoLocalAuth \u2013 the user was granted access with saved secret without local authentication   + pincode \u2013 Pincode granted the user access with local authentication |\n\n## iOS\n\n### How to enable Appdome\u2019s offline access to the app\u2019s files:\n\n```\n    NSString* onlineToken = @\u201cmyonlinetoken\";\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0NSString* offlineToken =

steps to create self-defending Mobile Apps that Initialize In-App Generated Seed without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1. ##### Upload a Mobile App to Appdome\u2019s Mobile App Security Build System\n\n   * **Upload Method:**\u00a0Appdome Console or DEV-API\n   * **Mobile App Formats:**\u00a0.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android\n   * **Data at Rest Encryption > Smart Offline HandoffCompatible With:**\u00a0Obj-C, Java, JS, C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, and more\n2. ##### Build the feature: Data at Rest Encryption > **Smart Offline Handoff**\n\n   * **Building Data at Rest Encryption > Smart Offline Handoff using Appdome\u2019s DEV-API:**\n     1. + Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed feature as shown below:\n\n     ![Create Fusion Set Smart Offline Handoff](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2024-06-20-at-14.14.56.png)\n\n     Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Data at Rest Encryption > Smart Offline Handoff feature  \n     **Note:**Naming the Fusion Set to correspond to the protection(s) selected is for illustration purposes only (not required).\n\n     + To add the Data at Rest Encryption> Smart Offline Handoff feature to this Fusion Set, follow the steps in section 3, Building the Data at Rest Encryption > Smart Offline Handoff feature via Appdome Console.\n     + Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c\u2026\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set, as shown in [Figure 1](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/how-use-external-seed-in-android-ios-encryption-key/?preview_id=1913&preview_nonce=0e7569730e&_thumbnail_id=-1&preview=true#figure_1)above, and get the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):  \n       ![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/assets/copy_fs_id.png)\n\n       Figure 2: Fusion Set Detail Summary  \n       Note:\u00a0Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n     + Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, App Center, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI, or other system:\n\n       - Build an API for the app \u2013 for instructions, see the tasks under\u00a0[Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link?__hstc=267077713.28abf8ad5abd079e57f8c5606075ba57.1702471003737.1717588253698.1717591236546.375&__hssc=267077713.3.1717591236546&__hsfp=4199485786)\n       - Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/orgs/Appdome/repositories)\n3. ##### Building the Data at Rest Encryption > **Smart Offline Handoff** feature via Appdome Console\n\n   Follow the instructions below to build the Data at Rest Encryption > In-App Generated Seed protection using the Appdome Console.\n\n   * **Where:**\u00a0Inside the Appdome Console, go to\u00a0**Build**>\u00a0**Security**\u00a0Tab >\u00a0**TOTALData\u2122 Encryption**\u00a0section.\n   * **How:**\u00a0Toggle (turn ON) **Data at Rest Encryption >Smart Offline Handoff**, as shown below.  \n     ***Note:*** In order to enable the Smart Offline Handoff feature, make sure that your app contains the \u201cOfflineFolderAccessed\u201d Threat Event implementation.\n   * Specify a **Designated Folder** into which data will be saved for offline access.  \n     On Android, this folder will be created on both  \n     /data/data/<app-bundle-id>/files and on/sdcard/Android/data/<app-bundle-id>/files.  \n     On iOS, the folder will be created under  \n     /var/mobile/containers/data/applications/bundle-id\n   * Optional \u2013 specify the **Session Timeout**, an expiration time-frame for offline access (in days \u2013 0 means no expiration time), or toggle the **Require Local Authentication**\u00a0switch to require the device Authentication for offline access.\n   * Optional: Enable the Store in Protected Memory option to allow keys and secrets to be automatically stored in protected memory. Protected memory items are encrypted while in use. **![Data At Rest Encryption > Smart Offline Handoff](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Data-at-Rest-Encryption-Smart-Offline-Handoff.png)**\n   * Figure 3: Initialize Smart Offline Handoff option\n   * When you select the Data at Rest Encryption > Smart Offline Handoff, you\u2019ll notice that the Fusion Set you created now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Data at Rest Encryption > Smart Offline Handoff.  \n     ![Saved Fusion Set Smart Offline Handoff](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Saved-Fusion-SEt-Smart-Offline-Handoff.png)\n   * Figure 4: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Data at Rest Encryption > Smart Offline Handoff protection\n   * Click\u00a0**Build My App**\u00a0at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in\u00a0[Figure 3](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/how-use-external-seed-in-android-ios-encryption-key/?preview_id=1913&preview_nonce=0e7569730e&_thumbnail_id=-1&preview=true#figure_3)).\n\n**Congratulations!**  Smart Offline Handoff protection has now been added to the mobile app.\n\n### How to Sign & Publish Secured Mobile Apps Built on Appdome\n\nAfter successfully securing your app using\u00a0Appdome, there are several available options to complete your project, depending on\u00a0your\u00a0app lifecycle or workflow.

It consists of three elements: a Threat Event, the data from each Threat Event, and the Threat-Score\u2122.\n\nThreat-Events streamlines the process for mobile developers by enabling them to register for, listen to, and consume real-time attack and threat data, courtesy of Appdome\u2019s suite of mobile app security, anti-fraud, and mobile anti-bot protection measures. This functionality offers mobile app developers the ability to customize business logic and the user experience based on the user\u2019s risk profile and the specific attack or threat presented while also ensuring that their mobile application workflows are aware of attacks and threats. Furthermore, it facilitates the passing of threat data to other record systems. These include app servers, mobile fraud analysis systems, SIEMs, and other data collection points.\n\nThe purpose of Threat Events is to enable Android and iOS applications to adapt and respond to mobile app attacks and threats in real-time. This will ensure the safety of users, data, and transactions.\n\n## **Mobile Application Threat-Events vs. Threat-Scores**\n\nAppdome Threat Events can be used as a stand-alone implementation in Unity Apps or in combination with Threat Scores. Threat Events provide in-app notifications of each attack or threat, as well as the metadata associated with the attack. Threat Scores provide the mobile developer with the ability to set a Threat Event event score for each threat, and receive the combined (aggregated) mobile end-user risk score at the time of the notification.\n\n## **Prerequisites**\n\nBefore implementing Threat-Events or Threat-Scores in your Unity app, ensure that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Appdome account ([**Create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.apk or .aab for Android)\n* Appdome account class: Appdome DEV or higher.\n* Mobile Application Source Code.\n* Signing Credentials: see [**Signing Secure Android Apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n* Threat-Events or Threat-Scores have been enabled ( turned ON) for a specific protection.\n* Correct identifiers for the Threat-Events for each protection.\n\n**Note:** The specific identifiers for each Threat Event and Threat Score are in the knowledge base article associated with each protection.\n\n**Android**\n\n1. **Enable Threat-Events** \n   * Select the checkbox next to Threat-Events for the desired runtime protection.\n   * This enables (turns ON) Threat-Events for that feature.\n2. **Enable Threat Scores**\n   * Click the up/down arrow associated with Threat Scores to assign a specific score to each protection.\n   * Assign a specific threat score between 1 and 999 to each protection.\n\n**Note:** Threat-Events and Threat Scores can be used with or in place of server-based mobile anti-fraud solutions.\n\nThe figure below illustrates the locations of Threat Events and Threat Scores for various protections available on Appdome, including runtime mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile Anti Bot, and more.\n\n![Rootdetect Ui Te](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RootDetect-UI-TE-1120x731.png)\n\n## **Communicating with Native Platforms in Unity**\n\nTo communicate with native Android platforms in Unity, developers typically use native plugins or platform-specific APIs. Here\u2019s a more detailed guide:\n\n1. **Native Plugins:** Write code in Java/Kotlin for Android outside Unity. Connect it with Unity using Unity\u2019s native plugin system. You can then call this code in Unity and receive messages back.\n2. **Unity\u2019s APIs:** Unity offers built-in APIs (`UnityEngine.Android`) to access device features directly from Unity scripts.\n3. **Third-Party Packages:** Explore Unity Package Manager or the Asset Store for pre-built solutions that simplify communication with Android platforms.\n4. **Asset Store Plugins:** Check the Unity Asset Store for plugins that provide ready-made solutions for native platform integration.\n\nPick the method that suits your project\u2019s needs and your team\u2019s skills.\n\n## Code Snippet Required for Using Threat-Events with Unity Apps with Native Android\n\nNative Android Plugin:\n\n1. Create a new Java file named **JavaBroadcastReceiverInterface.java.**\n2. Add the following lines, which define **JavaBroadcastReceiverInterface** native Java interface for consuming threat events (will be implemented on the C# side):\n\n   ```\n   package com.unity3d.player;\r\n   import android.content.Context;\r\n   import android.content.Intent;\r\n   public interface JavaBroadcastReceiverInterface \r\n   {\r\n       void onReceive(Context var1, Intent var2);\r\n   }\n   ```\n3. Create a new Java file named **JavaBroadcastReceiver.java**.\n4. Add the following lines, which define **JavaBroadcastReceiver** class that implements BroadcastReceiver and introduces **registerReceiver** native Java method, that will register to a Threat Event (will be called from the C# side):\n\n   ```\n   package com.unity3d.player;\r\n   import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;\r\n   import android.content.Context;\r\n   import android.content.Intent;\r\n   import android.content.IntentFilter;\r\n   public class JavaBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {\r\n       private static JavaBroadcastReceiverInterface receiver;\r\n       public JavaBroadcastReceiver(JavaBroadcastReceiverInterface unityReceiverProxy) {\r\n           receiver = unityReceiverProxy;\r\n       }\r\n       public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {\r\n           if (receiver != null) {\r\n               receiver.onReceive(context, intent);\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n       public void registerReceiver(Context context, String eventName) {\r\n           context.registerReceiver(this, new IntentFilter(eventName));\r\n       }\r\n   }\n   ```\n5. Create an Android Archive (.aar) from these files.\n6. Place the archive in **Assets/Plugins/Android.**\n\nC# Scripts:\n\n1. Create a new C# script named **UnityBroadcastProxy.cs.**\n2. Add the following lines, which implement **JavaBroadcastReceiverInterface** that consumes threat events******:******\n\n   ```\n   using System.Collections;\r\n   using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n   using UnityEngine;\r\n   using System;\r\n   public class UnityBroadcastProxy : AndroidJavaProxy\r\n   {\r\n       public UnityBroadcastProxy() : base(\"com.unity3d.player.JavaBroadcastReceiverInterface\") {}\r\n       public void onReceive(AndroidJavaObject context, AndroidJavaObject intent)\r\n       {\r\n           string eventID = intent.Call<string>(\"getAction\");\r\n           switch (eventID)\r\n           {\r\n               case \"RootedDevice\":\r\n                   string internalError = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"internalError\");\r\n                   string defaultMessage = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"defaultMessage\");\r\n                   string timestamp = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"timestamp\");\r\n                   string deviceID = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"deviceID\");\r\n                   string deviceModel = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"deviceModel\");\r\n                   string osVersion = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"osVersion\");\r\n                   string kernelInfo = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"kernelInfo\");\r\n                   string deviceManufacturer = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"deviceManufacturer\");\r\n                   string fusedAppToken = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"fusedAppToken\");\r\n                   string carrierPlmn = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"carrierPlmn\");\r\n                   string deviceBrand = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"deviceBrand\");\r\n                   string deviceBoard = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"deviceBoard\");\r\n                   string buildHost = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"buildHost\");\r\n                   string buildUser = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"buildUser\");\r\n                   string sdkVersion = intent.Call<string>(\"GetStringExtra\", \"sdkVersion\");\r\n                   //\r\n                   // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here\r\n                   //\r\n                   break;\r\n               // Add cases for other actions here...\r\n               default:\r\n                   Debug.Log(\"unknown event received\" + eventID);\r\n                   break;\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n   }\n   ```\n3. Create a new C# script named ThreatEventsImp.cs.\n4. Add the following lines, which add Appdome Threat-Events registration to Start()method (using the native Android callback registerReceiver):\n\n   ```\n   using System.Collections;\r\n   using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n   using UnityEngine;\r\n   using UnityEngine.Android;\r\n   public class ThreatEventsImp : MonoBehaviour\r\n   {\r\n       private AndroidJavaObject broadcastReceiver;\r\n       void Start() \r\n       {\r\n           // get current activity\r\n           AndroidJavaObject activity = new AndroidJavaClass(\"com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer\").GetStatic<AndroidJavaObject>(\"currentActivity\");\r\n           // get application cotext\r\n           AndroidJavaObject context = activity.Call<AndroidJavaObject>(\"getApplicationContext\");\r\n           // create new UnityBroadcastProxy\r\n           UnityBroadcastProxy broadcastProxy = new UnityBroadcastProxy();\r\n           // create new JavaBroadcastReceiver - onReceive will be called when the threat event occurs\r\n           broadcastReceiver = new AndroidJavaObject(\"com.unity3d.player.JavaBroadcastReceiver\", broadcastProxy);\r\n           // register threat events\r\n           broadcastReceiver.Call(\"registerReceiver\", context, \"RootedDevice\");\r\n       }\r\n   }\n   ```\n5. Place these scripts in **Assets/Scripts.**\n\n## **Compatibility with Android 14**\n\nUnity compatibility with Android 14 is seamless. The code sample provided above utilizes native platform implementations, ensuring that no modifications are needed to make your app fully compatible with Android 14.\n\n### **Special Considerations**\n\n* Replace the event identifiers in your ThreatEventsImp according to the selections you made while fusing the application. To find the relevant Threat-Event context key, search for the specific feature via our knowledge base and navigate to the code sample section in the relevant article.\n* You can stack multiple listeners for various events for comprehensive threat detection and response capabilities.\n* For detailed information on advanced usage and alternative methods of implementation, please refer to the official documentation on the [**Native Android Plugin**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AndroidNativePlugins.html), [**BroadcastReceiver**](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/broadcasts), and\u00a0[**NSNotificationCenter**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotificationcenter).\n\n## Meta-Data for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nBelow is the list of metadata that can be associated with each mobile application, Threat-Event, and Threat-Score in Unity Apps.\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n\nAt the discretion of the mobile developer, Unity Apps can consume some or all of the meta-data for each mobile application Threat-Event and Threat-Score and use it in combination with other mobile application data to modify the business logic or user experience when one or more attacks or threats are present.\n\n### **Using Conditional Enforcement for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores**\n\nConditional Enforcement is an extension of Appdome\u2019s mobile application Threat-Event framework. By using conditional enforcement, developers can control when Appdome enforcement of each mobile application protection takes place or invoke backup, failsafe, and enforcement to any in-app enforcement used by the mobile developer.\n\n### **Verifying Threat Events in Unity Apps**\n\nAfter you have implemented the required Threat-Event code in your Unity Apps, you can confirm that the Appdome protections in the Unity Apps properly recognize your Threat-Event implementation by reviewing the Certified Secure\u2122 DevSecOps certificate for your build on Appdome.\n\n![Certificate Root Detection Missing Te](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Certificate-Root-Detection-Missing-TE-e1750760709150.png)\n\nWhen Threat-Events implementation appears to be missing in your mobile application, the following indication will be shown in the Certified Secure DevSecOps certificate:\n\n![Android Missing Threat Events Implementation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Android_Missing_Threat_Events_Implementation-650x130.png)\n\nFor more information on how to retrieve the Certified Secure DevSecOps certification for your mobile application on Appdome, please visit the knowledge base article: [**Using Certified Secure\u2122 Android & iOS Apps Build Certification in DevOps CI/CD**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/certified-secure-android-ios/using-certified-secure-android-ios-apps-build-certification-in-devops-cicd/)\n\n### **Related Articles**\n\n* [**Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Kotlin Apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-kotlin-apps/)\n* [**Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Flutter Apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/use-threat-events-in-flutter-apps/)\n* [**Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Native iOS Apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-native-ios-apps/)\n* [**Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in React Native Apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-react-native-apps/)\n* [**Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Swift Apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-swift-apps/)\n* [**Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Native Android Apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-native-android-apps/)\n* [**Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Maui, Xamarin Apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-xamarin-apps/)\n* [**Implementing Threat Events \u2013 Best Practices**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/implementing-threat-events-best-practices/)\n* [**How To Implement Threat-Events in Java**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/implementing-threat-events-in-code/)\n\n## How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1732628905042.1732707966681.339&__hssc=79098507.3.1732707966681&__hsfp=3435076530)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### **Thank you!**\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

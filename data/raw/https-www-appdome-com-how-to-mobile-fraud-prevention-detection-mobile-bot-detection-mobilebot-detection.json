They often try to force-fit bot defense methods designed for web applications onto mobile frameworks. This mismatch often requires mobile app developers to change the mobile application network stack, remove valuable TLS-protecting network connections, or limit bot defense to singular hosts. The result of an increasingly mobile app-driven economy is that larger parts of the mobile infrastructure are left vulnerable to mobile bot attacks, fraud, ATOs, API abuse, credential stuffing, and more.\n\n## What is Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense?\n\nThe new MobileBOT\u2122 Defense solution offers mobile brands unparalleled bot detection, comprehensive intelligence, and rapid defense against malicious bots, credential stuffing, and ATOs in mobile app business lines.  \nAppdome\u2019s MobileBOT\u2122 combines several defense methods to address these weaknesses and provide a robust solution for securing mobile apps against malicious bots. MobileBOT\u2122 offers full support for all mobile languages and frameworks, including Obj-C, Java, JS, C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and more. Integration with your mobile apps is facilitated through a No-Code, No-SDK, and Fully Automated Delivery built to integrate seamlessly with mobile DevOps pipelines.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome\u2019s MobileBOT\u2122 Defense:\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s mobile app security build system for Mobile Bot Defense, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([create a free Appdome account here](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=79098507.401d371c0544861b105826ea18331520.1694613928928.1697639078004.1697699334183.107&__hssc=79098507.3.1697699334183&__hsfp=4225138836))\n* A license for\u00a0**MobileBOT\u2122**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project?__hstc=79098507.401d371c0544861b105826ea18331520.1694613928928.1697639078004.1697699334183.107&__hssc=79098507.3.1697699334183&__hsfp=4225138836) (.ipa for iOS device or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/?__hstc=79098507.401d371c0544861b105826ea18331520.1694613928928.1697639078004.1697699334183.107&__hssc=79098507.3.1697699334183&__hsfp=4225138836)\u00a0and\u00a0[**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/?__hstc=79098507.401d371c0544861b105826ea18331520.1694613928928.1697639078004.1697699334183.107&__hssc=79098507.3.1697699334183&__hsfp=4225138836))\n* A license for Threat-Event\u2122 Meta-Data\n* A license for ThreatScore\u2122 Data\n\n![Mobile Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Mobile_Mobile_Bot_Defense-1.png)\n\n## Overview of Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense Features\n\n### MobileBOT\u2122 Defense\n\n**Protected Host**The Mobile AntiBot solution is configured to allow the addition of multiple protected hosts. Each host is individually fortified with several security features such as mTLS Pre-Authentication, Session Risk, and Secure Certificate Pinning.\n\n**Rate Limit Connections**Learn more about\u00a0[How to Enforce Rate Limiting in MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/rate-limit-connections-anti-bot-defense/)\n\n**mTLS Pre-Authentication**Appdome\u2019s mTLS Pre-Authentication can be used as the fourth verification layer before the Anti-Bot payload is sent to the WAF using a P12 client certificate in the TLS handshake. mTLS Re-Authentication is a quick and easy way to identify good mobile app requests from bad ones.\n\nLearn more about [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Using P12 Distribution Certificate](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-ios-apps-using-p12-distribution-certificate/)\n\n**Heartbeat Solution**The Heartbeat Solution is an advanced security framework by Appdome designed to safeguard application sessions. It comprises four main elements: Session Risk, Safe Sessions, At-Risk Sessions, and a Payload Signing Key.\n\n**Note:** The heartbeat solution does not include secure certificate pinning, rate limiting, or client certificates.\n\n**Session Risk**Appdome\u2019s session risk employs a multi-layered approach with application fingerprinting to guarantee not only a tamper-proof payload but also to enhance the WAF\u2019s ability to thwart session replay attacks. This structure offers the WAF insight into the security status of the device running the protected app. Moreover, the WAF can obtain data on threats identified by the protected app and can accurately differentiate between attacks coming from various devices.\n\nTo guarantee that the anti-bot signal cannot be spoofed by an attacker, Appdome protects all data in transit with pre-packaged and optional features like Secure Certificate Pinning to the (WAF), TLS Session hardening, active MitM Defense, and optional **WAF encryption** for the Session Risk Payload (over and above the RSA Key).\n\n**Note:** Please be aware that **Security Certificate Pinning** and the **Anti Bot Pin to Host** are mutually exclusive. Implementing them together will result in a conflict within the engine. Ensure to use only one method at a time to avoid potential issues.\n\n**Note:** All protections available under \u201cStandard Device & Connection Risk\u201d are only accessible when the \u201cSession Risk\u201d feature is enabled.\n\n**Enforce URLs List:** Enter Specific URLs to be protected by MobileBOT\u2122 Defense. You can add hosts by clicking the `+ Add URL \u2018 button.\n\n**Safe Session**Represents sessions that are determined to be safe or not at risk of any threat.\n\n**At Risk Session**Represents sessions that are potentially under threat or have detected anomalies.\n\n**Payload Signing Key**The public key that Appdome uses to encrypt the payload.\n\n**Payload Timestamp**Learn more about\u00a0[How to Use Payload Timestamps In Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/learn-use-payload-timestamp-to-prevent-replay-attacks-and-stop-malicious-bots-using-appdomes-no-code-cyber-defense-automation/)\n\n**Appdome ThreatID\u2122**Learn more about\u00a0[How to Use Appdome ThreatID\u2122 In Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/understanding-appdome-threatid-in-appdomes-mobilebot-defense/)\n\n**Payload Nonce**Learn more about\u00a0[How to Validate a Nonce Payload with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/understanding-nonce-payload-in-appdomes-mobilebot-defense/)\n\n**Appdome Signed Payload**  \nEnsures data integrity and security by verifying the digital signature of each payload before connection.\n\n**Appdome AppID\u2122**  \nLearn more about\u00a0[How to Use Appdome AppID In Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/understanding-appdome-appid/)\n\n**Pin to Host**Learn more about\u00a0[How to Secure Android & iOS Apps with Pin to Host](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-pin-to-host-in-android-ios-apps/)\n\n### Anti-Bot Connection Hardening\n\nTo eliminate hijacking and replay attacks, Appdome\u2019s MobileBOT\u2122 Defense solution protects all data-in-rest with pre-packaged features such as data-at-rest encryption for all Anti-Bot configurations, secrets, keys, IDs, etc., as well as a protected memory space for all Anti-Bot functions.\n\nMitM Attack Prevention enables the performance of mTLS pre-authentication, monitors connections for MitM attacks, and safeguards connections and anti-bot payload in transit between the anti-bot solution and any industry standard WAF.  \n**Protect Anti-Bot Config at Rest**  \nEncrypts all Mobile Anti-Bot configurations, including host, keys, certificates, etc., at rest to prevent the harvesting.  \n**Protect Anti-Bot Config in-Memory**  \nPrevents attackers from harvesting Mobile Anti-Bot configurations, including host, keys, certificates, etc., in memory.  \n**Prevent Session Replay Attack**  \nAppdome detects and prohibits session replay attacks and reclaims SessionID for stale TLS sessions so that hackers cannot reuse them in their attacks.  \n**Prevent Session Hijacking**  \nAppdome detects, prohibits, and protects app connections from session hijacking by validating the server SSL certificate chain\u2019s authenticity and providing authenticity proof to the server on behalf of the client.  \n**Prevent Cookie Hijacking**  \nAppdome detects, prohibits, and protects app connections against cookie hijacking by validating the server SSL certificate chain\u2019s authenticity and providing authenticity proof to the server on behalf of the client.  \n**Malicious Proxy Detection**  \nAppdome detects any attempt to connect to or from unknown, untrusted, or malicious proxies or other intermediary devices.  \n**Deep Proxy Detection**  \nAppdome performs a deep inspection of proxies and proxy techniques, including header manipulation and redirects.\n\n### Mobile Device & Connection Risk\n\n**Mobile Anti-Bot Policy**\n\nOn-Device Bot Detection enables mobile developers to configure which on-device threats\u2014such as Root, Magisk, Emulators, Jailbreak, Fake Location, and more\u2014will contribute to session risk classification in the app. For each detection, developers define a DEVICETrust\u2122 level: Zero-Trust, which delays connection until checks are complete, or Runtime-Trust, which allows assessment during connection. For example, when adding Detect Fake Location as a detection, the session will be classified as compromised based on location spoofing.\u00a0 This configuration feeds into Mobile Device & Connection Risk, which tags each session as Safe or At-Risk and enables WAFs and backend systems to validate session authenticity in real time.\n\n**Note:** Please be aware that the **MitM Prevention** and **Mobile Anti Bot Policy** features are mutually exclusive. Implementing them together will result in a conflict within the engine. To avoid potential issues, ensure that you use only one method at a time.\n\n**Threat Intelligence Policy**\n\nThreat-Event Meta-Data is an optional configuration in Mobile Device & Connection Risk that enriches mobile bot detection payloads with additional environmental context, including operating system, device model, manufacturer, and SSL certificate metadata. These metadata fields are used by WAFs to assess whether the mobile session originates from a legitimate safe or at-risk endpoint.\n\nThreatScoreis another optional configuration that adds a numeric risk score to each user and device session, helping backend systems quantify and respond to bot and automation threats. This score reflects the cumulative risk based on detected mobile threats\u2014such as root, Magisk, emulators, or fake location\u2014and provides a simplified value to inform automated policy decisions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n### **Certify the MobileBOT\u2122 Defense features** in Android & iOS Apps.\n\nAfter building MobileBOT\u2122 Defense features, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the MobileBOT\u2122 Defense protection has been added and is protecting the app. To verify that the MobileBOT\u2122 Defense protection has been added to the mobile app, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:\n\n![Certified Secure Certification For Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Certified_Secure_Certification_For_Mobile_Bot_Defense.png)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use Session Risk in Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-session-headers-in-mobile-bot-defense/)\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps with Pin to Host](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-pin-to-host-in-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How to use MobileBOT Source\u2122 with Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-mobilebot-source/)\n* [How to use DEVICETrust\u2122 with MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-devicetrust-with-mobilebot-defense/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

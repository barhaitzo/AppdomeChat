These services facilitate robust access management, allowing IT to control employee access to applications and devices effectively. By integrating one of these trusted cloud-based platforms, organizations can guarantee that only authorized employees can access and utilize Appdome\u2019s comprehensive suite of mobile application security tools. This selective authentication is crucial for protecting the integrity and security of the operations conducted on the platform, ensuring that sensitive processes and data are managed exclusively by authenticated users.\n\nThis guide is divided into the following parts:\n\n* Configuring the Settings on Okta Admin Console\n* Defining the Person to Use Okta\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n* Admin-level privileges on Appdome ([contact support for assistance](http://support.appdome.com))\n\n## Configuring the Settings on Okta Admin Console\n\n### To add the configuration for Okta:\n\n1.

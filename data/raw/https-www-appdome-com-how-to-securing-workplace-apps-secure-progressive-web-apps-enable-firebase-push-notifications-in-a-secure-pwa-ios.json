They can do a lot of things; for example, they can show the latest weather, notify about flight schedules, alert on sports scores, or prompt a user to take an action, such as downloading a coupon or receipt, etc. Push messages are a one-way messaging channel, in that users cannot directly reply to them. They are usually sent from a server or cloud service (such as Firebase Cloud Messaging) to a subscribed user or a user who has granted an app permission allowing the push notification to be sent. Using Appdome, you can build a secure PWA that can display push notifications sent from Firebase Cloud Messaging.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article explains how developers or non-developers can enable push notifications using Appdome\u2019s Secure PWA with their existing Firebase service.\n\n## What is Appdome Secure PWA?\n\nAppdome Secure PWA is a no-code mobile development framework that enables anyone to convert any website into a mobile application in minutes \u2013 no code or coding required. Using Appdome, anyone can build a progressive web app (PWA) that runs on any iOS or Android device with a native-like experience. The only thing you need to convert any website into a mobile application is a reachable website. Simply input an existing URL into Appdome\u2019s app builder, select your choice of platform (Android, iOS, or cross-platform), and click Convert To App. Within minutes, the Appdome platform automatically converts the website into a mobile application that will run natively on any mobile device for the platform you selected.\n\n## 4 Easy Steps To Enable Firebase Push Notifications in an iOS or Android Secure PWA\n\nFollow these 4 easy steps to convert a website into an iOS or Android app using Appdome Secure PWA.\n\n1. From the **Add App** tab, Select **Create Secure PWA\u2122** and enter the **website address** for the website you wish to convert (Note, enter the full address, and ensure that the URL is reachable).\n2. Choose an **App Name,** then Choose the **App platform**: iOS, Android or both.\n   * For iOS \u2013 upload the **Provisioning Profile**.\n3. Under **Support Push Notifications,** enable the toggle for\u00a0**Use Firebase Cloud Messaging**\n4. Upload configuration file from Firebase Cloud Messaging (upload [plist for iOS app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client), [upload Json file for Android app)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client)\n5. Click **Convert To App**\n\n![11](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11.png)\n\n![2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.png)\n\n**Congratulations**! You now have converted your website to a progressive web app and enabled push notifications. You can find your PWA in your Appdome account (left navigation menu) with all the other app binaries that you\u2019ve previously added to your account.\n\n![Appdome Secure Progressive Web App (pwa)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Presentation5.png)\n\n\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome\u2019s Secure PWA\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Appdome-DEV access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* A license to Appdome Secure PWA.\n* A reachable website (URL)\n* Signing Credentials\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile) \u2013 see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1685002563837.1685258775647.167&__hssc=267077713.22.1685258775647&__hsfp=3783124442)\u00a0and\u00a0[**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1685002563837.1685258775647.167&__hssc=267077713.22.1685258775647&__hsfp=3783124442)\n\n### After Building Your Secure PWA\n\nAfter successfully converting your website into a mobile application using Appdome, there are several available options to complete your project, depending on\u00a0your\u00a0app lifecycle or workflow.

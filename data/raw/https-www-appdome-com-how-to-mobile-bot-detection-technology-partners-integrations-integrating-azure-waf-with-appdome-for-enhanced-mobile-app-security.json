When combined with Appdome\u2019s [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/) solution, businesses can achieve an unparalleled level of protection for their mobile applications. This article will guide you on configuring your **Azure Virtual Server** to connect to a WAF so it can work seamlessly with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense.\n\nBefore delving into the steps, let\u2019s understand some of the terms used:\n\n**MTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security):** Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a method for mutual authentication in which both parties in a network connection validate each other\u2019s SSL certificates against a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA). When integrating with Appdome, you can configure mTLS in two ways:\n\n* **Through Appdome\u2019s Docker image**, which provides built-in support for mTLS setup\n* **Via Azure Application Gateway**, if your deployment already includes this service.\n\nThis flexibility allows you to manage authentication at the layer that best fits your existing architecture.\n\n**Client Certificate:**\u00a0In cryptography, a client certificate is a type of digital certificate that is used by client systems to make authenticated requests to a remote server.\n\n**Safe Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are determined to be safe or not at risk of any threat.\n\n**At Risk Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are potentially under threat or have detected anomalies.\n\n**Header Payload:**\u00a0The data transferred in the header of HTTP requests or responses. Protecting this data ensures that it cannot be tampered with during transit.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Azure Virtual Server with Appdome-Protected Apps\n\nIn order to use the Azure Virtual Server in conjunction with Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* A configured and accessible Azure Virtual Linux Server\n* An Android or iOS app secured by Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense\n* An Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense License\n\n## How to Configure the WAF to Parse Safe Session and At Risk Session\n\nWhen Appdome\u2019s code is integrated into the Azure Virtual Server, it enhances the firewall\u2019s capability to determine the validity of a session. To categorize sessions as \u201cSafe Session\u201d or \u201cAt Risk Session\u201d, Appdome\u2019s code analyzes specific headers within incoming requests: Timestamp, Nonce, and SignedMessage. The Timestamp header allows Appdome\u2019s code to detect potential delay attacks by comparing the request\u2019s timestamp with the server\u2019s time. The Nonce, a unique random value, ensures the uniqueness of each request, protecting against replay attacks. The SignedMessage, typically an RSA-encrypted SHA256 hash of the timestamp, nonce, and a shared secret, ensures the integrity of the request.\n\n### Getting Started with Azure Virtual Server Setup and Configuration\n\nFollow these steps to configure a Linux server on GCP and Azure, and launch a Docker container with open network settings.\n\n**Note:** Make sure to replace placeholders such as *YOUR\\_VM\\_NAME, your-docker-image, your-username, and your-vm-ip with your own custom values and preferences.*\n\n### Setting up a Linux Server on Azure\n\n1. **Create a Resource Group**\n   * In the Azure portal, navigate to **Resource groups.**\n   * Create a **new resource group** to organize your resources.  \n     To learn more about managing Resource Groups on Azure, [please read this article.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal)\n2. **Create a Virtual Machine (VM)**\n   * In the Azure portal, go to **Create a resource -> Compute -> Virtual machine**\n   * Configure your VM instance, including selecting the Linux distribution you prefer (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).  \n     **Note:** Make sure to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic when configuring the firewall rules.\n3. **SSH into Your VM**Use SSH to connect to your VM:\n\n   ```\n   ssh your-username@your-vm-ip\n   ```\n4. **Running a Docker Container on Azure**Inside your VM, install Docker:\n\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\nTo learn more, see the installation instructions for [Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)\n\n## Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image\n\nAfter setting up your server of choice, proceed to configure the Appdome Docker Image as outlined in our dedicated knowledge base article, [How to Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image for MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/configure-appdomes-docker-image/).\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/)\n* [How to Configure GCP to work with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/configure-appdomes-docker-image-with-gcps-waf/)\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps in Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/use-appdome-build-2secure-in-azure-pipelines/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)!

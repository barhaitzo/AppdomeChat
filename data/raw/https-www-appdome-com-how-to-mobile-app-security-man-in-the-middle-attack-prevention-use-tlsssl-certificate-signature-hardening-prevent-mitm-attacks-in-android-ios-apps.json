Most certificates are hashed using a hashing algorithm to produce a fingerprint, which is then encrypted using the CA\u2019s private key.\n\nAppdome\u2019s\u00a0Certificate Signature Hardening protects all your application connections and enforces strong encryption methods such as RSA and ECC on each certificate signature.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for using Appdome to enforce\u00a0Certificate Signature Hardening\u00a0on any Android and iOS mobile app\n\nWe hope you find it useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## What Is SSL/TLS Certificate Signature Hardening?\n\n**SSL/TLS Certificate Signature Hardening** involves strengthening the process by which digital certificates are signed to prevent tampering or modification during man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Certificates are typically signed by certificate authorities (CAs) using cryptographic algorithms such as RSA or ECC to create a secure signature. This process ensures the certificate\u2019s integrity by hashing the certificate data and encrypting the result with the CA\u2019s private key. Attackers often try to modify or forge certificates in MitM attacks to intercept sensitive data exchanged between mobile apps and servers. By hardening the certificate signing process, developers ensure that only certificates with valid, secure signatures are trusted by the app. By hardening certificate signatures, developers protect sensitive app data, enabling secure communications that align with compliance standards, such as GDPR, which demand secure data transmission.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Mobile Apps with Certificate Signature Hardening?\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic Certificate Signature Hardening plugin protects mobile app connections by enforcing strong encryption methods, such as RSA and ECC, on each certificate signature. This ensures that only certificates with secure, valid signatures are trusted, preventing MitM attackers from modifying certificates or intercepting data. Mobile developers can use Appdome\u2019s Threat-Events\u2122 to gather data on certificate signature tampering attempts and create a customized user experience when such threats are detected, further strengthening app security.\n\n### Prerequisites for using\u00a0Certificate Signature Hardening\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Appdome-DEV access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see [**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n## How to Enforce\u00a0Certificate Signature Hardening\u00a0to Any Mobile App on Appdome\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to enforce\u00a0Certificate Signature Hardening:\n\n**Upload a Mobile App to Your Account**\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n**From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, go to the Security menu.**\n\n1.

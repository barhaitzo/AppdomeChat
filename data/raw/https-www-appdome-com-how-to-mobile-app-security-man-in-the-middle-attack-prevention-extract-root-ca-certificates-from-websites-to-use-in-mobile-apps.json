We will use https://appdome.com as an example.\n\n1. Use Chrome browser to open the required website; for example, https://appdome.com:  \n   ![Appdomewebsite](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/AppdomeWebsite.png)\n2. Click on the lock icon on the left of the website address and then on the row **Connection is secure**.  \n   ![connectionissecure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2024-02-19-at-17.40.03-540x366.png)\n3. Click on the *Show certificate* (arrow) icon on the right of the row\u00a0*Certificate\u00a0is valid*.  \n   ![Connection is secure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2024-02-19-at-17.41.41-489x366.png)\n4. In the newly opened window, switch to the **Details** tab.  \n   ![Details tab](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2024-02-19-at-17.27.20-594x731.png)\n5. Select the top certificate in the Certificate Hierarchy (make sure the scrollbar is all the way up).  \n   ![Exportcertificate](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2024-02-19-at-17.27.20-1-594x731.png)\n6. Click **Export**\u2026 on the bottom right to export the Root CA certificate.\n7. Save the certificate file.\n\n### Extracting all CA certificates from MAC\n\n**To extract all CA certificates from a MAC workstation:**\n\n1. Open\u00a0the *Spotlight* search**.**\n2. Enter *Keychain Access*.\n3. Open *Keychain Access*\n4. Select\u00a0**System Roots  \n   ![Systemroots](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2024-02-19-at-17.31.04-1266x731.png)**\n5. To select all the certificates at once, click on the top entry, scroll down to the bottom of the list, and click on the bottom entry while holding the \u201cShift\u201d button on your keyboard.  \n   ![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/m2-768x525.png)\n6. Right-click the selected list and select the **Export** command, as shown below.  \n   ![Exportcommand](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2024-02-19-at-17.33.45-1266x731.png)\n7. Save the certificates in an easily accessible folder, for example *Certificates.pem* in the **Documents** folder as suggested by default.  \n   ![Documentsfolder](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2024-02-19-at-17.34.45-1266x731.png)  \n   Now that all certificates are saved in a single file, you need to split the certificates so each certificate is saved in a separate file.\n8. Open Finder again and go to **Applications**\u00a0> **Utilities**\u00a0> **Terminal**.\n9. Click the Launchpad icon\u00a0in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal.\n10. Type:  \n    cd <Folder\\_Selected\\_For\\_Saving\\_Certificate\\_File>;  \n    in this example: cd Documents\n11. Copy and paste the following command into the terminal to split the certificates into separates files:  \n    mkdir Certificates && csplit -n5 -k -f Certificates/cert Certificates.pem \u2018/END CERTIFICATE/+1\u2019 {99999}\n\nNow, you should have a *Certificates* directory with certXXXXX files, while XXXXX is the certificate index.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.cb249e6cb815c754ee1ea4633650c79f.1683458843950.1683458843950.1683547752843.2&__hssc=79098507.1.1683547752843&__hsfp=3783124442)!

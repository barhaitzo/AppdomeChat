Use Appdome for BlackBerry Dynamics to build the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK to Native Android and iOS or apps build with any other framework, including Cordova, React Native, Maui, Xamarin, Ionic, Flutter Apps and more. Appdome is a no-code solution. Use Appdome to secure enterprise apps instantly.\n\n[BlackBerry Dynamics](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/apps/blackberry-dynamics) is a widely used UEM and BYOD use case in the corporate world. Many companies are using it to manage their Apps and devices within their organization.\n\n## How to Make Android and iOS Apps Work With BlackBerry Dynamics\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features, like the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK, in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding. When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured enterprise apps. There is no need to wrap or manually code the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK to your mobile apps. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nAppdome\u2019s technology adds the full BlackBerry Dynamics SDK into mobile apps, as well as standards, methods or protocols necessary, to mobile apps automatically. After using Appdome, mobile Apps will leverage the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK capabilities as if they were natively coded into the app.\n\nUsing Appdome to **Build** your apps with\u00a0the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK into mobile Apps is simple and fast.\u00a0Once **Building** is complete, you can deploy the\u00a0**Built**\u00a0App via\u00a0BlackBerry UEM and install the **Built** app on mobile devices via\u00a0BlackBerry Dynamics. All data created within the\u00a0App will be encrypted and protected inside a container, preventing other applications from accessing the App\u2019s data. This allows you to enjoy all of the features the\u00a0BlackBerry Dynamics SDK offers as well as the additional\u00a0security of\u00a0[Appdome Mobility Suite](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/guarantee-android-ios-compatibility-uem-mam/)\u00a0and\u00a0[BoostEMM by Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/boostemm-by-appdome/).\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Make Mobile Apps Work with BlackBerry Dynamics\n\nPlease\u00a0follow these 3 easy steps to make Android and iOS Apps work with BlackBerry Dynamics\n\n1. [**Upload**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0an Android or iOS App to Appdome\u2019s no code security platform (.apk, .aab, or .ipa)\n2. In the Build Tab, under Management and EMM Services, Select the **BlackBerry Dynamics SDK** (shown below)\n3. Follow the steps below and Click\u00a0**Build My App**\n\nHere are the detailed steps to make Android and iOS apps work with Workspace ONE.\n\n1. Enable\u00a0**EMM Services** open the **drop-down list**.\n2. Next, choose the **BlackBerry Dynamics SDK**\u00a0from the dropdown list.\n3. Then add the unique GD Entitlement ID\n4. Add the GD Entitlement Version\n5. Verify the **GD App ID** and **GD App Version \u2013**BlackBerry has restrictive policies for uploading apps. It must have a unique App ID that follows BlackBerry\u2019s regulations. \u00a0Here you can verify and modify the GD App ID and the GD App Version to match the requirements. By default, the GD App ID matches the app\u2019s bundle ID.\n\n![service selection on appdome for Blackberry Dynamics SDK ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2019-01-31-at-1.53.25-PM.png)\n\n### Configure your App with additional features (optional).\n\nIf you\u2019d like or need additional control over the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK implementation or need to configure the implementation in your app, please take a look at the following knowledge base articles:\n\n* [Appdome Mobility Suite](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-mobile-app-security/comprehensive-no-code-mobile-app-security-resources/) \u2013 provides detailed, gradual control over the BlackBerry Dynamic SDK implementation.\n* [BoostEMMTM](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/use-secure-browser-secure-mail-enterprise-apps/) \u2013 allows developers and mobility professionals to connect the App to secure BlackBerry browser and email client.\n\nEach of these features should be added to your selections\u00a0**before**\u00a0you click Build My App. That way, sections in these categories are included in the automated integration completed on Appdome.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready with your configurations, click **Build My App.**\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0 You now have a mobile App fully integrated with the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK!\n\n### Prerequisites for Making Android and iOS Apps Work With BlackBerry Dynamics\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to build secured apps with work with the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK\n\n* Appdome account (If you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[create a free Appdome account here)](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n### No Coding Dependency\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured enterprise apps with Workspace ONE.

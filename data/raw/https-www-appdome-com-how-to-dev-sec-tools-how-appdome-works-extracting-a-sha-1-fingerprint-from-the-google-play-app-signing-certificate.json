In these cases, the signing certificate must be trusted in the app by using the SHA-1 or SHA-256 fingerprint of the Google Play signing certificate.\n\nThis article explains how to extract the required SHA fingerprint from Google Play and use it with Appdome\u2019s Trusted Signing model. Trusted Signing allows Appdome to validate app integrity based on authorized signing certificates, regardless of where the app is signed. When signing on Appdome for Google Play, the Google SHA fingerprint is required. When using Private Signing / Auto-DEV Private Signing, both the Google signing certificate fingerprint and the local keystore fingerprint must be trusted.\n\n## How to sign apps on Google Play\n\nAppdome is a mobile security platform that allows users to secure Android and iOS apps using a no-code, click-to-add interface. When an app is protected with Appdome, it must be re-signed before distribution.\n\nTo distribute an Appdome-protected app through Google Play, you must extract the **SHA-1 or SHA-256 fingerprint** of the Google Play app signing certificate and add it to Appdome\u2019s **Trusted Signing** configuration. This allows Appdome to recognize Google-signed builds as trusted and prevents runtime integrity violations when Google applies its signing process.\n\nWhen using **Sign on Appdome** for Google Play distribution, the Google Play signing certificate fingerprint must be trusted. When using **Private Signing /** **Auto-DEV Private Signing**, both the Google Play signing certificate fingerprint and the local signing keystore fingerprint must be trusted to preserve Appdome\u2019s anti-tampering protections.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Appdome account\n2. [Android App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\n3. Application uploaded to Google PlayStore\n4. [Signing Credentials](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key)\n\n## How to Extract a SHA-1 or SHA-256 Fingerprint from the Google Play Signing Certificate\n\n### For Internal Testing and App Releases\n\nAfter logging into Google Play, you can extract a SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint and copy that into Appdome when signing [on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/automatic-code-signing-for-secured-android-apps-on-appdome/) or [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-android-apps-using-apksigner/):\n\nNavigate to [the Google Play Console and log in (or access Google Play from an Android device)](https://play.google.com/apps/publish)\n\n1. Choose the application you are signing\n2. Go to Setup \u2013> App Signing\n3. Copy/Download the SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint from the App signing certificate section.  \n   ![Google Console App Signing](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Google-Console-App-Signing.png)  \n   This app signing certificate (SHA-1 or SHA-256) is the fingerprint of the final signing certificate that will be distributed via Google Play. Insert this value while signing or private signing on Appdome.\n\n### For Internal App Sharing\n\nAfter logging into Google Play, you can extract an SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint and copy that into Appdome when signing [on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/automatic-code-signing-for-secured-android-apps-on-appdome/) or [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-android-apps-using-apksigner/):\n\nNavigate to [the Google Play Console and log in (or access Google Play from an Android device)](https://play.google.com/apps/publish)\n\n1. Choose the application you are signing\n2. Go to Setup \u2013> Internal App Sharing\n3. Copy/Download the SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint from the App certificate section.  \n   ![Internal App Sharing](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Internal-App-Sharing.png)\n\nThis app signing certificate (SHA-1 or SHA-256) is the fingerprint of the signing certificate that will be used for the app\u2019s internal sharing. Insert this value while signing or private signing on Appdome.\n\n### **Step by step instructions to Sign Secured Android App with SHA Fingerprint Google Certificate**\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to Sign a Secured Android App with SHA Fingerprint Google Cert.\n\n1. Select and APK/AAB app you\u2019d like to sign (the app needs to complete the Build process with Appdome for you to be able to sign it)\n2. In the upper navigation bar, select\u00a0**Sign**.\n3. Next to \u201cHow Would You Like to Sign?\u201d, select **On Appdome / Private Signing /Auto-DEV Private Signing**.\n4. Under **Trusted Signing Certificates**, click\u00a0**+**\u00a0to add a\u00a0**SHA-1 or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint**.\n5. When using **Private Signing /Auto-DEV Private Signing**, both the Google signing certificate fingerprint and the local keystore fingerprint must be trusted.\n6. (Optional) Add an\u00a0**Annotation**\u00a0to document certificate usage.\n7. Select the**Trusted Store Signing**\u00a0checkbox\n8. Select\u00a0**Sign My App**.\n9. (Optional) In the pop-up message, select\u00a0**OK**\u00a0to save your signing credentials. Otherwise, select\u00a0**Skip**. You can remove the credentials at any time by clicking\u00a0**Remove Signing Credentials**.\n\nBelow is the screenshot with detailed instructions for signing on to Appdome and signing in privately.\n\n**Sign on Appdome:**\n\n[![Android Sign On Appdome W Sha1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome_W_SHA1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Android_Sign_On_Appdome_W_SHA1.png)\n\n\u2026\n\n**Private signing:**\n\n[![Appdome Android Private Sign](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Appdome_Android_Private_Sign.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Appdome_Android_Private_Sign.png)\n\n**Auto-DEV Private Signing:**\n\n[![Appdome Android Auto Dev Private Sign](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Appdome_Android_Auto_Dev_Private_Sign.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Appdome_Android_Auto_Dev_Private_Sign.png)\n\nAppdome requires this value because several [Anti-Tampering](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/prevent-mods-code-changes-mobile-apps/) techniques within Appdome\u00a0[ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/fusing-apps-with-oneshield-by-appdome/) rely on the final signature certificate fingerprint to protect the application and verify that it has not been re-signed by an attacker or otherwise tampered with.\n\n## How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/) or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [Automated App Signing of Secured Android & iOS Apps on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/automated-app-signing-of-secured-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How to Enforce SHA-256 Digest in Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/enforce-sha-256-digest-in-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How to Trust Google Play Store Tests with Appdome-Protected Android Applications](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/trust-google-play-store-tests-with-appdome-protected-android-applications/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

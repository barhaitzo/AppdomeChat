This guide aims to assist mobile app developers using Appdome\u2019s mobile bot defense solutions in effectively generating and managing their key pairs.\n\n### Understanding Public and Private Keys\n\n**Definition and Roles**\n\n* **Private Key**: This key must be kept confidential and is used to encrypt data before secure transmission and decrypt received data. It is also essential to create digital signatures that authenticate the data\u2019s source and integrity.\n* **Public Key**: This key can be shared publicly and is used to decrypt data encrypted with the matching private key and to verify digital signatures.\n\n**Key Pair Relationship**\n\nThe public and private keys are integral to asymmetric cryptography, where data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other. This method ensures secure data transmission and the authentication of data sources without exposing sensitive keys.\n\n### Best Practices for Key Management\n\n* **Security**: Protect private keys with strong passwords and store them in secure, encrypted formats.\n* **Backup**: Implement regular backups of keys to different secure locations.\n* **Key Rotation**: Regularly update and rotate keys to safeguard against potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\nDevelopers need to install OpenSSL on their systems to generate keys. OpenSSL is a powerful toolkit for implementing the TLS and SSL protocols and offers a comprehensive suite of cryptographic functions, including key generation.\n\n### Steps to Generate Public and Private Keys Using OpenSS\n\nFollow these precise steps to generate your key pair using OpenSSL:\n\n1. Open terminal\n2. Install OpenSSL\n3. OpenSSL version: if no results appear, then do the following: \u00a0\n   * Install MacPorts\n   * Run the command on the terminal \u2013\n\n     ```\n     >sudo port install OpenSSL\n     ```\n4. **Generate a Private Key**:\n   * Use this OpenSSL command to create a 2048-bit RSA private key:\n\n     ```\n     openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048\n     ```\n   * This will generate a private key file named `private_key.pem`.\n5. **Generate the Public Key**:\n   * Extract the public key from your private key file with this command:\n\n     ```\n     openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem\n     ```\n   * This command produces a public key file named `public_key.pem`.\n6. **Secure the Keys**:\n\n* Move your newly generated key files to a secure folder, typically a keys directory within your local Web Application Firewall (WAF) folder, to ensure they are safely stored and managed.\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n\nThe following error can appear on WAF logs:\n\n```\n\"error:0407109F:rsa routines:RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_type_2:pkcs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\ndecoding error error:04065072:rsa\r\n\r\nroutines:RSA_EAY_PRIVATE_DECRYPT: padding check failed invoked from\u00a0  \r\n\r\nwithin ...\"\n```\n\nThis error results from a mismatch between the public and private keys on the server and client sides, which causes the padding check to fail.\n\n**Solution \u2013 validation of the match of keys:**\n\n1. Export the public key modulus and exponent\n   * ```\n     openssl rsa -pubin -text -in <public_key.pem>\n     ```\n2. Output should be:\n   * Public-Key: (2048 bit)\n   * Modulus:\n\n     ```\n     00:db:2d:9f:3e:3b:01:7d:16:8a:1a:07:7d:99:45:\u00a0\r\n     d6:59:50:81:bb:2c:a5:34:76:74:93:d3:3b:61:86:\u00a0\r\n     f1:5a:54:d7:3c:7c:db:b0:ba:0b:5f:ac:2f:1e:28:\u00a0\r\n     .......\u00a0\r\n     fe:fc:54:0b:b4:a6:78:cc:ae:59:38:c8:53:1f:e9:\u00a0\r\n     35:31\u00a0\r\n     Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n     ```\n3. Writing RSA key  \n\n   ```\n   -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\u00a0\r\n   MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA2y2fPjsBfR\u00a0\u00a0\r\n   aKGgd9mUXW\u00a0\r\n   ........\u00a0\r\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3MRAh1H9QCTXpl9Dj1iFCP2efrr+2OsPio+Wl6ep0PD+/FQLtKZ4zK5ZO\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MhTH+k1MQIDAQAB\u00a0\r\n   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n   ```\n4. Export the private key modulus and exponent:\n   * ```\n     openssl rsa -inform PEM -text -noout < private_key.pem\n     ```\n5. Output should be:\n   * Private-Key: (2048 bit, 2 primes)\n   * modulus:\n\n     ```\n     00:db:2d:9f:3e:3b:01:7d:16:8a:1a:07:7d:99:45:\u00a0\r\n     ................\u00a0\r\n     ................\u00a0\r\n     ................\u00a0\r\n     ................\u00a0\r\n     9e:7e:ba:fe:d8:eb:0f:8a:8f:96:97:a7:a9:d0:f0:\u00a0\r\n     fe:fc:54:0b:b4:a6:78:cc:ae:59:38:c8:53:1f:e9:\u00a0\r\n     35:31\u00a0\r\n     publicExponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n     ```\n\n**Note:**  \nThe integer number n is called \u201cmodulus.\u201d It defines the RSA key length and is a very large prime number.   \nThe exponent (e or d) is used to decode and encode the data.\u00a0\n\nThe number e is called the \u201cpublic key exponent,\u201d and the combination {n, e} forms the public key.   \nThe number d is called \u201cprivate key exponent,\u201d and the combination {n, d} forms the private key. \u00a0\n\nEnsure that the exponent and modulus are identical in both keys. If they are not, you will need to reconfigure the correct public and private keys.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use Session Headers in Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-session-headers-in-mobile-bot-defense/)\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps with Pin to Host](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-pin-to-host-in-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How to use MobileBOT Source\u2122 with Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-mobilebot-source/)\n* [How to use DEVICETrust\u2122 with MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-devicetrust-with-mobilebot-defense/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

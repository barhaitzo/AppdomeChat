While it offers benefits for legitimate remote support and collaboration, it can also pose a security risk if misused by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive applications and data. This guide walks you through how to test the Anti Remote Desktop Scam feature for iOS, a critical security layer provided by Appdome to ensure your application does not operate if TeamViewer is detected, effectively preventing unauthorized access attempts.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* To test Anti Remote Desktop Scam, you will need:\n  + Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1713348194707.1713354874943.269&__hssc=79098507.25.1713354874943&__hsfp=3563223768))\n  + A license for **Prevent Remote Desktop Scam**\n  + [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1713348194707.1713354874943.269&__hssc=79098507.25.1713354874943&__hsfp=3563223768) (.apk or .aab for Android)\n  + Signing Credentials (see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1713348194707.1713354874943.269&__hssc=79098507.26.1713354874943&__hsfp=3563223768)\u00a0)\n  + Two (2) mobile devices.\n\n## Performing the Test\n\n**To perform the test:**\n\n1.

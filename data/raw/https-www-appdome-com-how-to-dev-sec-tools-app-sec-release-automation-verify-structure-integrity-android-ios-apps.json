Whenever you upload an app to the Appdome platform, the system validates the integrity and structural components of the app automatically.\u00a0 App Integrity validation can also be done by customers.\n\nWe hope you find it useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Verify the Structure & Integrity of Android & iOS Apps\n\nAppdome app integrity validation automatically validates your uploaded mobile app every time you upload an app to the platform. When a mobile app has been uploaded to the Appdome platform, Appdome inspects the app and examines the app structure to validate its integrity and ensure that it\u2019s a valid .apk, .aab, or .ipa that has been correctly built.\n\nOnce activated, **Appdome Integrity Service** verifies the uploaded app has:\n\n* Valid binary structures\n* Valid binary file formats (info.plist and Android. manifest)\n* Valid SDK versions\n* Apple FairPlay breaches\n* Legal bundle identifier patterns\n* Deprecated file formats\n\nIn addition, the **Appdome Integrity Service**\u00a0ensures that uploaded apps will run smoothly\u00a0after you Fuse them with Appdome\u2019s features and capabilities.\n\nWhile fusing an app, Appdome automatically protects your app against debugging, tampering, reverse engineering, and a variety of other app-shielding features, all included in [Appdome ONEShield\u2122](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/fusing-apps-with-oneshield-by-appdome/).\n\n### Android Apps Requirements\n\nAppdome requires a full .apk or .aab file to protect the entire app. By allowing \u201cAndroid Bundle\u201d or by implementing the app with the [isSplitRequired](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#isSplitRequired) attribute, parts of the app build and feature modules can\u2019t be obfuscated, encrypted, or protected by Appdome.\n\nIn addition, for Android apps, the uploaded app shouldn\u2019t be exported in testOnly mode. To sign the full .apk file, when developing the app in Android Studio, Go to **Build** and **Generate Signed APK:**\n\n![Generate Signed Bundle Apk](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Generate-Signed-Bundle-APK.png)\n\n![Apk](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/APK.png)\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Verify the Structure & Integrity of Android & iOS Apps\n\nPlease\u00a0follow these 3 easy steps to verify the structure & integrity of Android & iOS apps\n\n1. [**Upload**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) an Android or iOS App to Appdome\u2019s no-code security platform (.apk, .aab, or .ipa)\n2. Appdome will automatically verify the structure and integrity of the app\n3. Review the results.\n\nThe integrity service will thwart the app upload process if the app\u2019s validity is malformed.  \nFor example:  \n![Failure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Failure.png)\n\nWhen the app\u2019s structure and integrity are verified, you will see this result.  \n![Success](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/success.png)\n\nNow you can proceed to the \u201cBuild\u201d part of the [Appdome Mobile Integration Workflow](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/using-no-code-security-android-ios-apps/) and start adding features, SDKs, and APIs to build and secure your new app!\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704976923959.1704983432297.346&__hssc=267077713.1.1704983432297&__hsfp=1931022262)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704976923959.1704983432297.346&__hssc=267077713.1.1704983432297&__hsfp=1931022262)!

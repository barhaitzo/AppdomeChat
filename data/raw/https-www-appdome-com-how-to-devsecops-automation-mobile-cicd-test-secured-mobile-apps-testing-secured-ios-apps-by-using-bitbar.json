Both can be used to test Appdome-secured mobile apps.\n\nWhen using Bitbar\u00a0to run Live App or App Automate testing on an Appdome-protected app, you can choose between either of the following methods:\n\n* **Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service (Recommended)**Customers with an Appdome SRM license can use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service to quickly and easily test their Appdome-secured mobile apps by using BitBar without the need for different Fusion Sets. With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida. For details, see [How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## Possibly Triggered Appdome Protection Features\n\nBelow are the Appdome security features that may be triggered during testing on BitBar, along with their behaviors under the Build2Test setting:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Deep Proxy Detection | Detects any proxy usage that could be employed during testing for network traffic analysis. | The app will detect the use of proxies but will not crash, allowing testing to continue. |\n| Secure App Signature | Ensures the app\u2019s signature hasn\u2019t been tampered with, which might be checked during installation on test devices. | The app will verify the integrity of its signature but will not crash, allowing the testing to continue. |\n| Detect App is Debuggable | Identifies if the app is running in a debuggable state, often used in testing for logging and debugging purposes. | The app will detect debug mode but will not crash, ensuring the testing can proceed uninterrupted. |\n| Anti-Swizzling | Protects against method swizzling which could be used to alter app behavior during testing. | The app will detect swizzling attempts but will continue running, allowing for uninterrupted testing. |\n| Jailbreak Detection | Detects if the testing environment simulates or involves jailbroken devices. | The app will detect the use of bypass tools but will not crash, allowing for uninterrupted testing. |\n| Block Jailbreak Bypass Tools | BitBar might have methods that detect jailbreak bypass tools. | Build2Test ensures that the app blocks jailbreak bypass tools while allowing testing to continue. |\n| Enforce Cipher Suites | Confirms that the app enforces secure cipher suites, which could be critical in testing network security. | The app will enforce specific cipher suites but will not terminate or crash, allowing secure and continuous testing. |\n\n## **Live App testing \u2013 iOS**\n\n**To initiate the App Live test of your iOS test app in Bitbar**:\n\n1. [**Log in to your BitBar account**](https://cloud.bitbar.com/). Alternatively, if you do not yet have an account, [**Create an account**](https://smartbear.com/product/bitbar/free-trial/).\n2. Under\u00a0**Live Testing,**\u00a0click\u00a0**Start Mobile App Live Test**.\n3. Select a device or a device group (shown on the right side) from the displayed list.  \n   ![Bitbarapplelistofdevices](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BitbarAppleListOfDevices-650x313.png)\n\nThe list is alphabetically sorted by manufacturer, so Apple devices will probably show first. Alternatively, you can use filters (on the left) to find a device matching your preferences.  \n\nAfter a device is selected, it is displayed on the screen. Various device-related options are displayed on the right, and an additional menu is displayed on the bottom left side.\n\n![Bitbarselectedappledevice](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BitBarSelectedAppleDevice-599x366.png)\n\n* Click **Files** on the left-side menu, and then **Upload or choose Files +**.  \n  ![Bitbaruploadorchooseapple](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BitBarUploadOrChooseApple-577x366.png)  \n  A file library with the previously uploaded app files is displayed.\n* Select the app you would like to test, and then install and launch the selected app on the test device.  \n  If you have not yet uploaded the test app,\u00a0do so now by clicking\u00a0**the Upload File** button at the top and then selecting\u00a0it.  \n  **Note**: The files in the app library are sorted alphabetically and include files from all platforms.  \n  ![Fileslibrary](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FilesLibrary-644x366.png)\n* Perform your tests manually.\n* Click **STOP** when done.  \n  The test session details will be displayed, and the test results will be available for later viewing under **Live Testing > Test Results**.\n\n## Automation App Testing \u2013 Appium iOS Client Side\n\nBitBar does not have specific Appium capabilities that trigger Appdome\u2019s protection. However,\u00a0it is important to follow the\u00a0app-building recommendations on Appdome, as previously described in sections *Testing on iOS Apps*\u00a0and\u00a0**Live App Testing\u2014iOS**.\n\n## Automation App testing \u2013 iOS Server Side\n\nBitBar allows you to test your app by uploading your test code and running it on their cloud, using various automation frameworks such as Appium, Robot, and Selenium.\n\n**To test your app on the iOS server side**:\n\n1. After successfully building and signing your app on Appdome,\u00a0[**Log in to your BitBar account**](https://cloud.bitbar.com/). Alternatively, if you do not yet have an account, [**Create an account**](https://smartbear.com/product/bitbar/free-trial/).\n2. Under\u00a0**Automation,**\u00a0click\u00a0**Create Automated Test.**\n3. Select **iOS** as the target OS type.  \n   ![Ios Target Os Type](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-Target-OS-Type-650x135.png)\n4. Use the\u00a0**Select a****Framework**\u00a0section to click\u00a0**Server Side (Appium and other frameworks)**.  \n   ![Ios Selectframework](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-SelectFramework-650x127.png)\n5. Use the **Choose Files** section to click on **Click to choose or upload a file** and select your test app and the test code (.zip) from the displayed list.  \n   If the app and the test code file are not in the displayed list, click **Upload File, upload your test app and the test code .zip file, and** then select both for testing.  \n   ![Choosefilessection](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ChooseFilesSection-650x242.png)\n6. Use\u00a0the **Choose Devices**\u00a0section to select any of the following options:\n   1. **Use\u00a0existing device group**Allows you to provide the name of the previously created device group.\n   2. **Use\u00a0chosen devices**This allows you to select the test device from the list of available devices.\n   3. **Use currently idle devices**\n\n      Allows you to let BitBar select test devices that are currently idle.\n\n      Slide the blue circle on the bar below to indicate the number of devices you want to include in the test.  \n      ![Ios Choosedevice](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iOS-ChooseDevice-650x235.png)\n7. Click **Create and run an automated test**.\n8. When done, click on **Go to results**.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\nMost automation test tools can typically be used in one of two modes:\u00a0**emulator mode**\u00a0and\u00a0**real device** **mode**(specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cemulator mode\u201d instead of \u201creal device mode,\u201d the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device. This is expected because Appdome [ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) protects apps from running on emulators/simulators. Instead, it would be best if you run the automation test tool on a real device mode.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on BrowserStack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-on-browserstack/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on BrowserStack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-appdome-secured-ios-apps-by-using-browserstack/)\n* [Test Appdome-secured Android Apps on Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-android-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-saucelabs-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/appsec-release-orchestration-testing-protected-mobile-apps-test-appdome-secured-android-apps-by-using-saucelabs/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1679322760586.1679391001880.3&__hssc=267077713.3.1679391001880&__hsfp=2327634395)!

A valid signature, which uses an Apple-issued certificate, ensures the integrity of an app and stands as proof that the app comes from a known and approved source and has not been tampered with. By enforcing mandatory code signing, Apple ensures that no third-party app loads unsigned code resources or uses self-modifying code.\n\nDuring the Appdome app build process, adapters are added to the app to achieve the functionality requested. As a result, the app\u2019s original signature is invalidated and must be resigned to allow deploying the app on mobile devices.\n\nAppdome allows signing an app via the\u00a0**Sign** tab using any of the following methods:\n\n* **On Appdome**Allowing Appdome to take care of the entire signing process. You only need to provide the signing credentials. For details, see the topic [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps without Xcode.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode)\n\n* **Private Signing**Gives you full responsibility for handling the entire signing process. For further information and in-detail instructions, see the topic [How to Privately Code Sign Sealed iOS Apps using DevSecOps Build System](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/privately-code-sign-sealed-ios-apps-using-devsecops-build-system).\n\n* **Auto-DEV Private Signing**Allows you to sign the app without uploading the signing certificate to Appdome\u2019s cloud service.  \n    \n  Appdome provides you with a script (.sh file), which runs on your trusted environment and signs the app by using your credentials (certificate and password) as input. For details, see the topic [How to Automate Secure iOS App Code Signing in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/automate-secure-ios-app-code-signing-in-devops-cicd/).\n\nAs part of the Appdome signing process of secured iOS apps, by using either Auto-dev Private Signing or Signing on Appdome, you are required to extract and upload a [**Provisioning Profile**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-ios-apps-with-a-p12-distribution-certificate/) and an [**entitlement**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/extract-and-use-ios-entitlements-files-for-signing-secured-ios-app/) file **for each executable** in the app, and when using signing on Appdome, a [**P12 certificate and its password**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/p12-certificate-file/).\n\nThis article provides instructions for automating secure iOS App code signing in DevOps CI/CD**.**\n\n## **Prerequisites for Using Appdome\u2019s Auto-DEV Private Signing Script**\n\n* Appdome account\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[IDEAL](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/choosing-appdomes-ideal-account/)\u00a0or Higher.\n* [Appdome-DEV access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* [iOS Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-p12-distribution-certificate/)\u00a0(namely, [**P12 certificate and its password**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appdome/knowledge-base/p12-file), [**entitlement files**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/extract-and-use-ios-entitlements-files-for-signing-secured-ios-app/), and [provisioning profile](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-ios-apps-with-a-p12-distribution-certificate/)) \u2013 verify that the certificate was added to your local Keychain.\n* Mac OS X computer with:\n  + Python software (version 2.7 or higher)\n  + [Codesign](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html) \u2013 Apple utility that\u00a0adds the signature directly to the executable file (Xcode version 10.1 or higher). You can check if the tool is available\u00a0to you simply by running \u201c**which codesign**\u201d on\u00a0your terminal.\n\n## **How to Securely Automate iOS App Signing In CI/CD**\n\nWith Appdome, you can Securely Automate iOS App Signing within a CI/CD without uploading the signing certificate to Appdome\u2019s cloud service.\n\n**Appdome\u2019s Auto-Dev Private Signing iOS Apps script** allows users to sign built-in apps locally without uploading the signing certificate to Appdome\u2019s cloud service. The unsigned app is embedded in the script generated by Appdome. Running the script in a trusted environment extracts and signs the app using a certificate in your key chain.\n\n### 3 Easy Steps to Securely Automate iOS App Signing In CI/CD\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to securely automate iOS app signing in CI/CD:\n\n1. From within the **Sign** tab, select the signing method **Auto-DEV Private Signing.**\n2. Upload the\u00a0**Provisioning Profile** that matches your signing certificate, wait for Appdome to verify the signing parameters, and then click on the Auto-DEV sign Privately button.  \n   **Note**: If your application contains multiple executable files, you must upload a provisioning profile for each file.  \n\n   Optional: Toggle ON the option **Manual Entitlements Matching** if you want to set an entitlement plist file to use when signing an app on Appdome.\n\n   When this feature is off, Appdome creates an entitlements file based on the entitlements used to sign the non-protected app.  \n   For further details and an in-depth manual on obtaining the entitlement file for your app, see the topic\u00a0\u201c[How to Extract and Use iOS Entitlements Files for Signing Secure iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-ios-apps-using-a-local-appdome-supplied-script/).\u201d\n3. When the Signing Script Generation is complete, click **Next**.\n\n   ![Select Auto Dev Private Signing For Your Ios App](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Select-Auto-DEV-Private-Signing-for-your-iOS-app.png)\n4. Click **Download\u00a0My Built App** to download the automatic private signing script (sign.sh).  \n   Your Appdome-Built unsigned app is embedded in this script.  \n   ![Click download my built app](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-19.48.31-1080x731.png)\n\n**Optional:**\u00a0Save or Remove Signing Credentials  \nAppdome allows saving signing credentials to streamline future signing processes.  \nAdditionally, if the signing credentials are no longer needed or need to be updated, they can be removed directly from the Sign Tab by clicking the Remove Signing Credentials button.  \n![Remove Signing Credentials From Your Ios App](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remove-signing-credentials-from-your-iOS-app-1300x608.png)\n\n### **How to Run Auto-DEV Private Script:**\n\nTo run the automatic private signing script, execute the following command:\n\n```\n./sign.sh --signer <\"Signer Identity\" or sha-1 hash> --output <signed_app_name>.ipa\n```\n\nFor additional details about signer identities and P12 files, see topic **[**P12 certificate and its password**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appdome/knowledge-base/p12-file)****.**\n\nIf you need help finding the value to enter for the Signer Identity, you can run this command:\n\n```\n./sign.sh --help\n```\n\nNote!\n\nIn some environments, you may be required to grant executable permissions to the signing script (using chmod +x command):\n\n```\nchmod +x sign.sh\n```\n\nThe **Signer Identity** is how the script identifies the certificate in the work stations Keychain Access. You can use either the certificate\u2019s **common name** (marked with double quotes) or its **SHA-1 fingerprint**.\n\n**To extract the certificate common name\u00a0/ SHA-1 fingerprint**:\n\n1. On your computer, open the **Keychain Access** app.\n2. Select the certificate you would like to add.\n3. Open the options menu (left click) and select **Get info**.\n4. Get the\u00a0certificate common name\u00a0**/ SHA-1 fingerprint.  \n   ![Screen Shot 2022 10 04 At 11.57.14](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-04-at-11.57.14-650x262.png)**![Screen Shot 2022 10 04 At 11.58.10](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-04-at-11.58.10-650x81.png)\n\n#### **Important Note!**\n\nCodesign needs authorized access to your signing certificate in the Keychain. The password for your keychain is normally your user\u2019s password (the one used for logging in to your computer). To ensure that the automatic private signing script runs without interruptions, you are strongly advised to set the option\u00a0**\u201cAlways Allow** for authorized access to the Keychain.\u201d\n\nNow, you can run the automatic private signing script with your Signer Identity value.\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have multiple certificates with the same common name, the script prompts you to use the SHA-1 fingerprint (which is always unique). If you enter invalid identifiers (type or non-existent certificate), the script will display an error and print all of the valid identities:\n\n```\n$ ./sign.sh --signer <invalid_singer> --output signed_app.ipa\r\n\r\n>>>\r\n\r\nERROR: The identity: invalid_signer was not found in the keychain.\r\n\r\nValid identities by name are:\r\n\r\niPhone Distribution:\r\n\r\nValid identities by sha-1 are:\n```\n\nThe script notifies whether the Signer Identity you are trying to use does not match the provisioning profile that is used for sealing the app and shows you the valid identities:\n\n```\n$ ./sign.sh --signer <mismatched_singer> --output signed_app.ipa\r\n\r\n>>>\r\n\r\n'INFO: Successfully matched certificate SHA-1 fingerprint [] in keychain\r\n\r\nERROR: The input certificate doesn\"t match the provisioning profile.\r\n\r\nValid certificates are:\r\n\r\nCert: [iPhone Distribution: ], with fingerprint: []\n```\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [**support.appdome.com**](http://support.appdome.com/ \"http://support.appdome.com/\") or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Privately Code Sign Sealed iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/privately-code-sign-sealed-ios-apps/)\n* [How Appdome Enables Signing Secured iOS Apps without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n* [Automated App Signing of Secured Android & iOS Apps on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/automated-app-signing-of-secured-android-ios-apps/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

Appdome\u2019s Copy-Paste Prevention allows organizations to create trusted app groups with copy-paste prevention controlled by the EMM\u2019s DLP policy to more apps.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for using Appdome to Extend EMM Copy-Paste Prevention to trusted mobile apps and control the copy-paste policies via an EMM\u2019s DLP Policy.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Use Trusted App Groups with Copy Paste Prevention\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there are no required infrastructure changes or configuration changes required inside the app. The Appdome technology adds any EMM SDK and relevant standards, frameworks, configurations and more to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all. The monitoring of the clipboard access from the app\u2019s code including its libraries would ordinarily require a developer to implement. Using Appdome, mobile apps will adhere to EMM security policies as if the EMM SDK and Copy-Paste Prevention were natively coded to the app.\n\nBy default, mobile app users are normally able to copy and paste information from one app to another. However, mobile app use inside organizations may contain confidential or sensitive information. As such, EMMs have copy-paste policies enforced by their SDKs to limit copy and paste capabilities. Most EMMs either block copy-paste altogether or allow copy-paste between specific apps only. Appdome\u2019s enhanced copy-paste prevention allows organizations to create specific mobile apps trust groups to extend copy-paste functions between more apps. Using Appdome\u2019s enhanced copy-paste prevention, Appdome encrypts the mobile app clipboard and decrypts it if two conditions are met (a) the app is in DLP policy\u2019s authorized apps, and (b) that mobile app is in the trust group created on Appdome (i.e., Appdome-built apps created in the same Appdome Account or Team). Trying to copy-paste protected data from apps outside the DLP policy or into non-authorized apps will result in a message telling the user that the data he tried to paste is protected.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Copy/Paste Prevention\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of Copy/Paste Prevention on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* One of the supported EMM accounts, [Intune](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/make-mobile-apps-work-microsoft-intune-app-sdk/), [VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-vmware-workspace-one/make-android-ios-apps-work-workspace-one/),\u00a0or [BlackBerry Good](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/make-android-ios-apps-work-blackberry-dynamics/)\n* DLP policy that supports Copy/Paste Prevention. For example:\n  + Microsoft Intune DLP configuration instructions can be found [here](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/intune-boostemm-policy/)\n  + BlackBerry Dynamics DLP configuration instructions can be found [here](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/prevent-blackberry-dynamics-data-leakage-mobile-apps/)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## The Easy Steps to Use Trusted App Groups with Copy Paste Prevention\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add\u00a0Copy/Paste Prevention by Appdome to a Mobile App:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n#### **From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add Copy/Paste Prevention**\n\nAppdome adds\u00a0Copy/Paste Prevention to all apps built with an EMM service. The feature will take effect at runtime according to the EMM\u2019s DLP policy.\n\nSelect the **Build Tab**. *Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*\n\nBeneath the Build Tab, you will find several service options. Select **Management**.\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n\n1. Click the **EMM Services** toggle to the right to enable integration with an Enterprise Mobility Management service. A list of available EMM providers will appear.\n2. Choose your desired EMM service from the list\n3. For Microsoft Intune, Appdome will default to Copy-Paste Prevention by Appdome (shown below).\n4. For all other EMM Vendors, users can toggle \u201cON\u201d Copy-Paste Prevention by Appdome.\n5. Click Build My App.\n\n### \n\nTrusted mobile apps are created by Fusing multiple mobile apps from the same Appdome Account or Team using Copy/Paste Prevention by Appdome. Appdome-built apps that share this feature and are\u00a0created in the same Appdome Account or Team will automatically form a trust group on users devices.\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integration, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to add an EMM SDK and\u00a0Copy/Paste Prevention\u00a0to the mobile app in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!** When your integration is complete, you will see the notice below. You now have a mobile app fully integrated with\u00a0Copy/Paste Prevention. Build more apps with this setting to extend EMM Copy-Paste Prevention to Trusted Mobile apps.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Success.png)\n\n## After adding\u00a0Copy/Paste Prevention\u00a0to a Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAfter you have added Appdome\u00a0Copy/Paste Prevention\u00a0to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### **Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built App**\n\nAppdome is a full featured mobile integration platform.

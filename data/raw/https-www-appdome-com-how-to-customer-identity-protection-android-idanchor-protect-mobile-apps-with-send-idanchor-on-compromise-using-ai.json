This identity is a unique, tamper-resistant fingerprint created from deep, hard-to-alter attributes of the device and app environment.\n\nSend IDAnchor on Compromise is designed for mobile apps that need to take immediate action when a security issue occurs. For example, if rooting, hooking frameworks, emulator use, or other forms of malicious activity are detected, the app will instantly receive the device\u2019s IDAnchor value. This feature is especially useful in fraud response, session risk scoring, and account protection, where fast, data-driven decisions depend on having a verified device identity associated with the threat event.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Mobile Apps With Send IDAnchor on Compromise\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic **Send IDAnchor on Compromise** plugin automatically delivers the device\u2019s IDAnchor value when a runtime threat or attack is detected. Developers can use this identity to assess risk, trigger custom defenses, and improve real-time fraud protection.\n\nBelow is a list of metadata that can be associated with each IDAnchor payload, true device attributes, and Advertising ID protections. Additionally, you can retrieve the IDAnchor Threat Events context keys for [Android](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/customer-identity-protection/android-idanchor/protect-mobile-apps-with-idanchor-using-ai/) or [iOS](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/customer-identity-protection/ios-idanchor/protect-ios-apps-with-idanchor-using-ai/).\n\n**Payload Context Keys**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| immutableDeviceID | The current ID Anchor value, as calculated for the device in the session. |\n| immutableDeviceIDDetections | Any security detections associated with the IDAnchor from the current session. |\n| installationID | The Application [Install ID](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/customer-identity-protection/android-idanchor/protect-mobile-apps-with-app-install-id-using-ai/); a unique ID assigned to the application installation on the device.

Compromise** , you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **Send IDAnchor on Compromise**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see [**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n## How to Implement Protect IDAnchor on Compromise in Mobile Apps Using Appdome\n\nOn Appdome, follow these **3 simple steps** to create self-defending Mobile Apps that **Protect IDAnchor on Compromise** without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1. ### [**Designate**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) the Mobile App to be protected.\n\n   1. #### Upload an app via the Appdome Mobile Defense platform GUI or via Appdome\u2019s DEV-API or CI/CD Plugins.\n   2. **Mobile App Formats:** .ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android\n   3. **Send IDAnchor on Compromise is compatible with:**\n      Obj-C, Java, JS, C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, and more.\n2. ### Select the defense: **Send IDAnchor on Compromise**.****\n\n   1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the Send IDAnchor on Compromise feature as shown below:\n\n      ![fusion set that contains Send IDAnchor on Compromise](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/android_fs_image.png)\n\n      Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Send IDAnchor on Compromise feature\n\n      1. Follow the steps in Sections [2.2-2.2.2](#2.2) of this article to add the Send IDAnchor on Compromise feature to your Fusion Set via the Appdome Console.\n      2. When you enable IDAnchor\u2122 you'll notice that the Fusion Set you created in step 2.1 now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Send IDAnchor on Compromise.\n\n         ![Fusion Set applied Send IDAnchor on Compromise](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/idanchor_android_fs.png)\n\n         Figure 2: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Send IDAnchor on Compromise protection\n           \n         Note: Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n      3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c...\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set. Copy\n         the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):\n         ![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/./assets/copy_fs_id.png)\n\n         Figure 3: Fusion Set Detail Summary\n      4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI or other system:\n         1. Refer to the [Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link) for API building instructions.\n         2. Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python).\n   2. #### Add the **Send IDAnchor on Compromise** feature to your security template.\n\n      1. Navigate to **Build**  > **IDAnchor** tab > **Android IDAnchor** section in the Appdome Console.\n\n         Like all other options in ONEShield\u2122, Send IDAnchor on Compromise is turned on by default, as shown below:\n         ![Send IDAnchor on Compromise option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Android_IDAnchor_Send_IDAnchor_on_Compromise_Toggle-2.png)\n\n         Figure 4: Selecting Send IDAnchor on Compromise   \n         Note: The App Compromise Notification contains an easy to follow default remediation path for the mobile app end user. You can customize this message as required to achieve brand specific support, workflow or other messaging.\n\n      - Toggle On **IDAnchor\u2122** > **Send IDAnchor on Compromise**.\n          \n        ![Send IDAnchor on Compromise option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Android_IDAnchor_Send_IDAnchor_on_Compromise_Toggle-2.png)\n\n        Figure 4: Selecting Protect IDAnchor on Compromise\n   3. Initiate the build command either by clicking **Build My App** at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in Figure 4)\n      or via your CI/CD as described in Section [2.1.4](#2.1.4).\n\n   **Congratulations!** The Send IDAnchor on Compromise protection is now added to the mobile app\n3. ### **Certify the Send IDAnchor on Compromise feature in Mobile Apps**\n\n   After building Send IDAnchor on Compromise, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the Send IDAnchor on Compromise protection has been added and is protecting the app. To verify that the Send IDAnchor on Compromise protection has been added to the mobile app, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:\n   ![Send IDAnchor on Compromise shown in Certificate secure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Android_Certified_Secure_Certification_For_IDAnchor-8.png)\n\n   Figure 5: Certified Secure\u2122 certificate\n\n   Each Certified Secure\u2122 certificate provides DevOps and DevSecOps organizations the entire workflow summary, audit trail of each build, and proof of protection that Send IDAnchor on Compromise has been added to each Mobile app. Certified Secure provides instant and in-line DevSecOps compliance certification that Send IDAnchor on Compromise and other mobile app security features are in each build of the mobile app.\n\n## Using Threat-Events\u2122 for IDAnchor on Compromise Intelligence and Control in Mobile Apps\n\nAppdome Threat-Events\u2122 provides consumable in-app mobile app attack intelligence and defense control when **IDAnchor on Compromise** is detected. To consume and use Threat-Events\u2122 for\nIDAnchor on Compromise in Mobile Apps, use AddObserverForName in Notification Center, and the code samples for Threat-Events\u2122 for IDAnchor on Compromise shown below.\n\nThe specifications and options for Threat-Events\u2122 for IDAnchor on Compromise are:\n\nThreat-Event\u2122 Elements | Protect IDAnchor on Compromise Method Detail || Appdome Feature Name | Send IDAnchor on Compromise |\n| Threat-Event Mode | |\n| OFF, IN-APP DEFENSE | Appdome detects, defends and notifies user (standard OS dialog) using customizable messaging. |\n| ON, IN-APP DETECTION | Appdome detects the attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (app chooses how and when to enforce). |\n| ON, IN-APP DEFENSE | Uses Appdome Enforce mode for any attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (gather intel on attacks and threats without losing any protection). |\n| Certified Secure\u2122 Threat Event Check | x |\n| Visible in ThreatScope\u2122 | x |\n| Developer Parameters for Protecting IDAnchor on Compromise Threat-Event\u2122 | |\n| Threat-Event **NAME** |  |\n| Threat-Event **DATA** | reasonData |\n| Threat-Event **CODE** | reasonCode |\n| Threat-Event **SCORE** | || currentThreatEventScore | Current Threat-Event score |\n| threatEventsScore | Total Threat-events score |\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| carrierPlmn | PLMN of the device. Only available for Android devices. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| deviceBrand | Brand of the device |\n| deviceBoard | Board of the device |\n| buildUser | Build user |\n| buildHost | Build host |\n| sdkVersion | Sdk version |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n\n  \n\nWith Threat-Events\u2122 enabled (turned ON), Mobile developers can get detailed attack intelligence and granular defense control in Mobile applications and create amazing user experiences for all mobile end users when IDAnchor on Compromise is detected.\n\n  \n\nThe following is a code sample for native Mobile apps, which uses all values in the specification above for Send IDAnchor on Compromise:\n\n  \n\n**Important!** Replace all placeholder instances of <Context Key> with the specific name of your threat event context key across all language examples. This is crucial to ensure your code functions correctly with the intended event data.\nFor example, The <Context Key> could be the message, externalID, OS Version, reason code, etc.\n\n

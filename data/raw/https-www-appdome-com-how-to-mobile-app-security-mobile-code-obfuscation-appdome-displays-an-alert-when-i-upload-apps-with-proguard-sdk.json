If Appdome users attempt to upload mobile applications containing ProGuard, the upload will be blocked, and you will receive a message prompting you to disable ProGuard before proceeding. This is done specifically to avoid specific conflicts that certain ProGuard protections can cause if you attempt to implement Appdome.\n\n## What is ProGuard?\n\nProGuard is an open-source command-line tool that reduces app size by shrinking bytecode and obfuscates the names of classes, fields and methods in an Android app.\n\n## Why Can\u2019t I Use ProGuard and Appdome in the same app?\n\nIn certain cases, ProGuard can collide with Appdome\u2019s implementation of **Obfuscate App Logic**. Therefore, whenever an app is recognized as having ProGuard, Appdome does the following:\n\n* Shows a visual indication in the app preview.  \n  ![Prevent conflicts with Proguard SDK](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SDK-Indication-650x242.png)\n* Displays an additional alert inside the Build **Tab**\u00a0which instructs the user how to resolve the conflict by removing ProGuard from their app. ![Prevent conflicts with Proguard sdK](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ProGuardNotification-1300x117.png)\n\n## How to Disable ProGuard with Groovy\n\n1. Got to the build,gradle of your app\n2. Mark the *minifyEnabled* and *shrinkResources* configurations as \u201cfalse\u201d\n\n**Note:** If you require additional information, please refer to this developer guide on how to [Shrink,\u00a0obfuscate,\u00a0and optimize your app](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#java)\n\n```\nandroid {\r\n    buildTypes {\r\n        release {\r\n            // Enables code shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization for only\r\n            // your project's release build type. Make sure to use a build\r\n            // variant with `debuggable false`.\r\n            minifyEnabled false\r\n\r\n            // Enables resource shrinking, which is performed by the\r\n            // Android Gradle plugin.\r\n            shrinkResources false\r\n\r\n            // Includes the default ProGuard rules files that are packaged with\r\n            // the Android Gradle plugin. To learn more, go to the section about\r\n            // R8 configuration files.\r\n            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(\r\n                    'proguard-android-optimize.txt'),\r\n                    'proguard-rules.pro'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\n```\n\n## How to Disable ProGuard with Kotlin\n\n1. Got to build,gradle of your app\n2. Mark the *minifyEnabled* and *shrinkResources* configurations as \u201cfalse\u201d\n\n```\nandroid {\r\n    ...\r\n    buildTypes {\r\n        getByName(\"release\") {\r\n            isShrinkResources = false\r\n            isMinifyEnabled = false\r\n            proguardFiles(\r\n                getDefaultProguardFile(\"proguard-android.txt\"),\r\n                \"proguard-rules.pro\"\r\n            )\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\n```\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* [Beta Android and iOS Testing and Release Program for Appdome Secured Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-os-compatibility/beta-android-and-ios-testing-and-release-program-for-appdome-secured-apps/)\n* [How to Protect Dynamic Features](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-cheat-prevention/mobile-app-modding-detection/protecting-dynamic-features/)\n* [How Appdome Enables Signing Secured iOS Apps without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.f7b44dd7e2a2333d92cd2e27bb6333a3.1683799662430.1691075378363.1691384913172.201&__hssc=267077713.10.1691384913172&__hsfp=2646886911)!

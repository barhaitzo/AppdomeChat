Root CA certificates are normally stored on a device\u2019s trusted CA store. Certificate Pinning is the process in which an app stores specific certificates or public key hashes in the app itself, thereby foregoing the verification process as described above. Instead, the app verifies a server certificate or CA certificate it received directly against the stored certificate or public key hash. This knowledge base article details how to use certificate pinning in enterprise mobile apps.\n\n## How to Use Certificate Pinning in Enterprise Mobile Apps\n\nif your app uses an internal Certificate Pinning solution to trust the server, you will need to turn on \u201cFavor Certificate Pinning\u201d:\n\n1. Go to the Build Tab\n2. Select the Access menu\n3. Turn on\u00a0Per-App VPN Routing\n\n![Favor Certificate Pinning switch](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FavorCertificatePinning_1.png)\n\n4. You will see a warning message that other features are being disabled. Click Proceed.\n\n![Favor Certificate Pinning warning](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FavorCertificatePinning_2.png)\n\n### Favor Certificate Pinning Compatibility\n\nTo allow Apple\u2019s\u00a0Per-App VPN to handle the traffic, some Appdome features will be turned off automatically, or an error will be displayed\n\n* [Mobile Access and MicroVPN Profiles](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/use-in-app-micro-vpn-remote-access-mobile-apps/)\n* [User Agent](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/use-mobile-apps-user-agent-secure-nac/) (android only)\n* [Any non-NTLM Authentication Profiles](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-mobile-sso/use-enterprise-authentication-mobile-apps/)\n* [Identity services](https://www.appdome.com/knowledgebase-category/mobile-identity/)\n\nEven though Per-App VPN may tunnel an app\u2019s entire network connectivity, you are still able to secure your app by using complementary\u00a0Appdome features such as:\n\n1.

Appdome seamlessly integrates with top mobile testing solutions, enabling customers to enhance mobile app security within their existing application lifecycle with the speed and agility of DevSecOps.\n\n**Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service (Recommended)**  \nCustomers with an Appdome SRM license can use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service to quickly and easily test their Appdome-secured mobile apps using Perfecto\u00a0without the need for different Fusion Sets. With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida.\n\nFor details, see\u00a0[How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## General Information About Testing in Android Apps\n\nAppdome protection features that may be triggered:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Detect Developer Options | Perfecto might enable developer options to facilitate testing, which is detected as a potential security risk. | The app will detect this but will not crash, allowing testing to continue. |\n| Block Android Debug Bridge (ADB) | Perfecto uses ADB for interactions during tests, which this feature blocks to prevent unauthorized control. | The app will detect ADB usage but will not crash, ensuring smooth testing. |\n| Prevent App Screen Sharing | Perfecto records the screen during tests, triggering the screen-sharing protection. | The app will recognize the screen recording but will continue running without crashing. |\n| Anti-tampering (on .aab apps) | Perfecto might modify the app package, triggering the anti-tampering protection. | The app will detect the modification but remain stable and functional during the test. |\n| Keylogging Prevention | Testing scripts that simulate inputs in a way that resembles keylogging might trigger this feature. | The app will detect potential keylogging behavior but will not crash. |\n| Detect Unlocked Bootloader | Perfecto\u2019s devices might have unlocked bootloaders, which are detected as a security risk. | The app will acknowledge the unlocked bootloader but will continue operating normally during testing. |\n| Anti Remote Desktop Control | Perfecto might use remote control tools during tests to trigger this protection. | The app will detect remote control attempts but will not terminate the session, allowing testing to proceed. |\n\n## Upload the App to the Perfecto Repository\n\n1. Log into your Perfecto cloud at ***<your-cloud>*. app.perfectomobile.com**  \n2. Click on **\u201cAccount Setup\u201d**.  \n3. Choose **\u201cRepository\u201d** from the top bar.\n\n![Perfecto Bar](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/perfecto-bar-2.png)  \n4. Click the upload button located at the bottom-right corner.\n\n![Perfecto Logo](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/perfecto-logo-3.png)\n\n5. Choose and upload your app.  \n6. Select and define additional data (e.g., private/public repository, name, tags) and then upload the app.\n\n![Androidupload A File](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ANDROIDupload-a-file.png)\n\n## Live App Testing\n\n1. Switch to the **\u201cManual Testing\u201d** tab in the top bar.\n\n![Perfecto Manual Testing](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Perfecto-Manual-Testing-1-650x165.png)\n\n2. Select a device and click **\u201cOPEN\u201d**.\n\n![Select Android Device](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Select-Android-DEvice.png)  \n3. Once the device is initialized, click on the application\u2019s icon and then **\u201cINSTALL NEW**.\u201d\n\n![Perfecto Aandroid Install App](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/perfecto-aandroid-install-app.png)  \n4. Choose your app from the repository folder.\n\n5. Click Next\n\n![Select Android App From Repository](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Select-Android-app-from-repository.png)\n\n5. Configure additional settings.\n\n6. Click Install App. Once installed, you can use the app and test it.\n\n![Install App](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/INSTALL-APP.png)  \n**NOTE**  \nIn case of any issues with the app, please send the device logs to Appdome Support by following these steps:  \n1. End the test and mark your results to save them.  \n2. Enter the link of your report.\n\n![Perfecto[android] Release Device](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/perfectoandroid-release-device.png)  \n3.\u00a0Look for the export button at the top right of the screen. Clicking it will open a dropdown menu from which you can download the device logs.\n\n![Export To Ppdf](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/export-to-ppdf-2.png)\n\n## Automating App Testing on Android\n\nPerfecto has several Appium capabilities, namely, a series of key-value pairs that allow you to configure your tests on Perfecto.  \nFor further details, see the [Capabilities Builder \u2013 Appium](https://help.perfecto.io/perfecto-help/content/perfecto/automation-testing/appium.htm)\u00a0webpage.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n**Issue: App Fails to Run on Testing Device**\n\n**Symptom**: The Appdome-secured application fails to launch or crashes when running automated tests.\n\n**Possible Cause**: Most automation test tools can typically be used in one of two modes:\u00a0**Emulator Mode** and\u00a0**Real Device** **Mode** (specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cEmulator Mode\u201d instead of \u201cReal Device Mode,\u201d the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n* Ensure that the automation test tool is set to **Real Device Mode**. Appdome\u2019s [ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/)\u00a0feature prevents the app from running on emulators or simulators.\n* Verify that the testing environment is using an actual device, not an emulator.\n\n**Issue: App Exits Unexpectedly or Displays Security Violation Message**\n\n* **Symptom**: The app closes unexpectedly or shows an error message stating, \u201cApplication has violated security policies, and it will be shut down.\u201d\n* **Possible Causes**:\n  + The app detects the presence of conditions it is protected against, such as running in an emulator, tampering, reverse engineering, or root detection.\n  + The testing tool might be running in **Emulator Mode** instead of **Real Device Mode**.\n* **Solution**:\n  + Switch the testing tool to **Real Device Mode** or **Manual Mode** to prevent the app from detecting an insecure environment.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-android-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [Test Appdome-secured Android Apps by Using SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/appsec-release-orchestration-testing-protected-mobile-apps-test-appdome-secured-android-apps-by-using-saucelabs/)\n* [Testing Secured iOS Apps by Using SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-saucelabs-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on BitBar](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-using-bitbar/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on Browserstack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-on-browserstack/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1723978986269.1723982330479.140&__hssc=267077713.5.1723982330479&__hsfp=4047532501)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

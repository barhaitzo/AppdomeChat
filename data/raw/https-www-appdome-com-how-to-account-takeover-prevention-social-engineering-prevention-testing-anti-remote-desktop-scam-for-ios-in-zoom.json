As the platform is utilized by businesses, educational institutions, and social groups for remote communication, securing these interactions becomes paramount. This guide walks you through the steps to verify that your protected application incorporates Anti-Remote Desktop Scam effectively, ensuring it cannot run in tandem with Zoom, thereby safeguarding user interactions and sensitive data.\n\n**Note:**  \nThe option of controlling a session remotely can only be explicitly given by the participant who is sharing their screen with the Zoom desktop client. Therefore, a person who joins a meeting on an iPad or iOS device cannot request or give remote control. For more details, see the [Zoom Support website](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control#h_01FTC34QRH80TJ0987BEP1R9BW).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo test Prevent Remote Desktop Scam, you will need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **Prevent Remote Desktop Scam**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS)\n* Signing Credentials (see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\u00a0and\u00a0[**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n* One iPhone device\n* One Macbook\n\n## Step-by-Step Process to Test **Prevent Remote Desktop Scam** in Zoom\n\n**Here is how to conduct the test:**\n\n1.

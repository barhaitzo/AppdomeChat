In particular, they want a way to automatically distribute enterprise apps to the Intune store to ensure continuous integration and evolution of mobile apps. On Appdome, organizations have the ability to create enterprise apps and automatically distribute enterprise apps to the Intune Store. To create an enterprise app, organizations add the Intune SDK and\u00a0[other services from Intune](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/boostemm-by-appdome/) to an app instantly. Then, they can automatically distribute the newly customized enterprise app to the Intune store directly from the Appdome platform. This knowledge base article provides a step-by-step guide on how to auto publish secure enterprise apps built with Intune to the Intune Store.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Automatic Deploy to Intune App Store\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher\n* Appdome-GO\u2122 \u2013\u00a0Upgrade to an\u00a0Ideal Appdome Go User.

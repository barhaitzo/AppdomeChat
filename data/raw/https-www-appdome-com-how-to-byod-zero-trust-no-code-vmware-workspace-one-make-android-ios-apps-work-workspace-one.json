Use Appdome\u2019s TOTALMobility for VMware Workspace ONE to build the Workspace ONE SDK to Native Android and iOS or apps build with any other framework, including Cordova, React Native, Maui, Xamarin, Ionic, Flutter Apps and more. Appdome is a no-code solution.\u00a0 Use Appdome to secure enterprise apps instantly.\n\nThank you for your interest in Appdome and we hope you find this article useful.\n\n## What Is TOTALMobility for VMware Workspace ONE\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features, like the VMware Workspace ONE SDK, in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured enterprise apps. There is no need to wrap or manually code the Workspace ONE SDK to your mobile apps. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nTOTALMobility for VWware Workspace ONE is an Appdome bundle that delivers customer choice, feature richness, and implementation control for every mobile deployment. With TOTALMobility for VWware Workspace ONE, Appdome offers customers choice by supporting a diversity of mobile security, network access and enterprise authentication services together with VMware Workspace ONE, which they can integrate into any iOS or Android app \u2013 instantly, without code or coding.\n\nFor example, VMware customers can deploy custom versions of any internally developed or 3rd party mobile app integrated withVMWare Workspace ONE, F5 Access Manager and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) cloud SSO service and secured by the Appdome Mobile Security Suite.\n\nIn addition to the unique ability to create multi-service implementation templates that can be added to any Android and iOS app, developed in any framework, instantly and without coding, customers can\u00a0use TOTALMobility to add security to all the mobile APIs in the app. The net result is a custom version of the mobile app, built according to the customer\u2019s specific enterprise requirements and fully secured and protected from hackers and malicious attacks.\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Make Android and iOS Apps Work With Workspace ONE\n\nPlease\u00a0follow these 3 easy steps to Make Android and iOS Apps work with Workspace ONE\n\n1. [**Upload**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\u00a0an Android or iOS App to Appdome\u2019s no code security platform (.apk, .aab, or .ipa)\n2. In the Build Tab, under Management and EMM Services, Select the **VMware Workspace ONE** (shown below)\n3. Follow the steps below and Click **Build My App**\n\nHere are the detailed steps to make Android and iOS apps work with Workspace ONE.\n\n1. Enable or turn \u201cON\u201d\u00a0**EMM Services**and open the drop-down list.\n2. Next,\u00a0choose **VMware Workspace ONE (AirWatch) SDK**\u00a0from the drop-down list.\n3. Change the App Bundle ID (optional).\n4. Change the App Version (optional).\n5. Change the App Version code (optional).\n\n![Make Android and iOS Apps Work With Workspace ONE](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Presentation5-1.png)\n\n### Configure your app with additional features (optional).\n\nIf you\u2019d like or need additional control over the VMware Workspace ONE (AirWatch) SDK implementation or need to configure the implementation in your App, please take a look at the following knowledgebase articles:\n\n* [Appdome Mobility Suite](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/Appdome-Mobility-Suite-Overview)\u00a0\u2013 provides detailed, gradual control over the VMware Workspace ONE (AirWatch) SDK implementation.\n* [BoostEMMTM](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/boostemm-by-appdome/)\u00a0\u2013 allows developers and mobility professionals to connect the App to VMware Workspace ONE (AirWatch) browsers, email clients, etc.\n* [MicroVPN](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/achieve-secure-remote-mobile-app-access-microvpn/)\u00a0\u2013 provides secure, mobile enterprise connectivity for any mobile App (connecting to enterprise SSL, VPN and Proxies).\n\nEach of these features should be added to your selections\u00a0**before**\u00a0you click **Build My App**. That way, sections in these categories are included in the automated integration completed on Appdome.\n\nClick \u201c**Build\u00a0My App\u201d** to complete Appdome\u2019s VMware Workspace ONE (AirWatch) SDK integration to the App.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0When your implementation is complete, you\u2019ll see the notice below.

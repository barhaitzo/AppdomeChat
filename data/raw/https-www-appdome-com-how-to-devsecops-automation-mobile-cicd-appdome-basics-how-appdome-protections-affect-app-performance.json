By leveraging advanced techniques in mobile security, Appdome provides a robust solution that not only protects applications from threats but also ensures a seamless experience for users, regardless of the device they are using. This balance between security and performance is crucial in today\u2019s mobile environment where users demand both safety and speed.\n\nAppdome is built to minimize performance impact on mobile apps. By integrating only selected features, running on secure side threads, and avoiding unnecessary main thread usage, Appdome ensures that security protections only minimally affect startup time, memory consumption, or overall App Performance. Each feature can be carefully chosen based on the specific needs of the application, allowing developers to customize the security measures without overloading the app\u2019s resources. This targeted integration process is essential for maintaining efficiency while enhancing security.\n\n#### Selective Integration\n\nOnly the security features enabled during fusion are linked and compiled into the Appdome library. This ensures your app contains only what has been chosen\u2014nothing extra is added that could slow down performance. For instance, if an app does not require certain anti-malware features, these can be omitted, making the app lighter and faster. This level of customization is vital for developers aiming to optimize their application\u2019s performance while still providing necessary security measures.\n\n#### Awareness of User Experience\n\nAppdome serves some of the world\u2019s largest brands and billions of end-users. Appdome takes care to ensure that ANR events, crash rates, and user experience metrics are not impacted. Our engineering approach is designed to safeguard performance while delivering enterprise-grade security.\n\n#### Thread Management\n\nAppdome executes security functions on secure side threads, offloading as much work as possible away from the app\u2019s main UI thread. By avoiding the main thread, Appdome ensures security checks do not interfere with normal app operations or responsiveness. This method not only improves overall performance but also enhances user experience, as users can engage with the app without perceivable delays.\n\n#### Effect on Main Thread\n\nAppdome\u2019s protections may only affect the main thread when encrypted resources are required early in the app lifecycle\u2014for example, during startup. In this case, Appdome must decrypt the resource before the app can proceed, which can momentarily block the main thread. This behavior is necessary for the app to function properly and is limited to specific use cases. Appdome mitigates this impact by implementing strategic loading techniques, ensuring that users experience minimal delay during startup phases.\n\nAppdome is committed to delivering strong mobile app security without compromising performance or user experience.

Developers can confidently integrate Appdome\u2019s security features, knowing that they will not detract from the user experience. As security threats continue to evolve, solutions like Appdome are essential for ensuring that mobile applications remain safe and efficient.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\nExplore further how Appdome can enhance your mobile app\u2019s security and performance by accessing our [Knowledge Base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/).

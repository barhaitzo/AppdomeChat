Troubleshooting secured Android apps using ADB enables you to connect an Android device over a USB cable to your computer.\u00a0 With this connection you can uninstall apps, issue shell commands to your device, install apps, and do more administrative functions that help while troubleshooting. For more information on this see the [[Logcat command-line tool article](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat.html)] and view this article on [how to install and use ADB](https://www.howtogeek.com/125769/how-to-install-and-use-abd-the-android-debug-bridge-utility/).\n\n### Prerequisites for Troubleshooting Secured Android Apps Using ADB\n\nIn order to use ADB, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).\n* [Platform-tools](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html) that include **ADB** in their package.\n* USB Driver for the mobile device\n* Android app that have diagnostic logs enabled\n\nTo facilitate the usage of **ADB**, you need to allow **USB debugging** on your device:\n\n1.

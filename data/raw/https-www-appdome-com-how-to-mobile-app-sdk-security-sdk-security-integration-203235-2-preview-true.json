This feature allows SDK developers to benefit from Appdome\u2019s security solutions while keeping the implementation details and the use of third-party security vendors confidential. It is essential for preventing attackers from identifying and understanding where and how Appdome\u2019s protections operate within the SDK.\n\n## Benefits of Using Obfuscate SDK Protect\n\n* **Code Confidentiality:** Ensures the methods of integrating Appdome\u2019s security features within the SDK remain undisclosed.\n* **Enhanced Security:** Shields against reverse engineering and tampering by making it challenging for attackers to detect and understand the security mechanisms in place.\n* **Vendor Discretion:** Facilitates the discreet incorporation of third-party security measures, which is\u00a0pivotal for maintaining strategic partnerships and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122:\n\nBefore you can utilize Obfuscate SDK Protect, ensure you have the following:\n\n* An active Appdome account. [**Create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1723360812418.1723367212567.116&__hssc=267077713.1.1723367212567&__hsfp=4047532501)\n* A license for\u00a0**Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122**\n* **Your Mobile SDK** (accepted formats include xcframework.zip for iOS or .aar for Android).\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Activating Obfuscate SDK Protect\n\nFollow these **simple steps** to create a self-defending Mobile SDK that includes **Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122** :\n\n1. **Upload Your Mobile SDK to Appdome**\n   * **Mobile SDK Formats:** (xcframework.zip for iOS, or .aar for Android)\n   * **Compatibility**: Compatible with Objective-C, Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, and more.\n2. **Configure and Name Your Fusion Set**\n   * Create a Fusion Set and name it according to the security features it includes (naming for illustration purposes only).  \n     ![New Fusion Set Obfuscate SDK Protect](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-11-at-11.55.11-1.png)  \n     Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Obfuscate Security Features feature.\n3. **Build with Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122**\n   * Navigate to the **Build SDKProtect\u2122** tab within the Appdome Console and access the **SDK Threat-Shielding** section.\n   * Ensure **SDK Threat-Shielding** is enabled; Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122 should be active by default.![Check Mark Obfuscate Sdk Protect](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Check-Mark-Obfuscate-SDK-Protect-2-1190x731.png)\n   * When you enable SDK Threat-Shielding, you\u2019ll notice that the Fusion Set you created now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122![Saved Fusion Set Obfuscate Sdk Protect](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saved-Fusion-Set-Obfuscate-SDK-protect-1.png)  \n     Figure 4: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122 protection\n   * Click **Build My SDK**\u00a0at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in\u00a0[Figure 3](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/203235-2/?preview=true#figure_3)).\n\n### Certify Your Build\n\nAfter building Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122 protection has been added and is protecting the SDK. To verify that the Obfuscate SDKProtect\u2122 protection has been added to the mobile SDK, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:  \n![Certificate Obfuscate Sdk Protect](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Certificate-Obfuscate-SDK-Protect-1.png)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[How to Use Appdome SDKProtect to Secure Mobile iOS SDKs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/use-appdome-sdkprotect-to-secure-mobile-ios-sdks/)\n\n[How to Use Appdome SDKProtect to Secure Mobile SDKs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/use-appdome-sdk-protection-for-mobile-apps/)\n\n[How to Obfuscate Mobile SDK Logic Using Appdome SDKProtect\u2122](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/protect-your-sdk-with-appdome/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

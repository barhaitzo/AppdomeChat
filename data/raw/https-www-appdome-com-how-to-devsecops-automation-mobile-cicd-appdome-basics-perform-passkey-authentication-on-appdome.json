Unlike traditional login methods, which use credentials (username and password) that are stored on websites and applications, thereby making them vulnerable to phishing and hacking attempts, passkeys are stored only on the user\u2019s device. As a result, using a passkey means there is no password for would-be fraudsters to intercept. For further details, see [Google documentation.](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys)\n\nThere are two types of passkeys:\n\n* **Platform passkey**  \n  Created on a computer, by using either a password or a touch device, and is platform specific (Mac OSX/Windows).\n* **Cross-platform passkey**  \n  Created on an external device, namely: either a mobile phone or a tablet.\n\nWhile users can delete or add devices, they can only have one passkey of each type at a time.\n\n## How does Appdome Implement Passkey Authentication?\n\nThe first time you log in to an Appdome system, you will see the message below.\n\n![Passkey for Appdome - Say hello](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SayHello-549x366.png)\n\nIf you click **Add Passkey**, the dialog box **Create a Passkey** is displayed. For details, see instructions below.\n\nIf you click **Not Now**, you can add a passkey as follows:\n\n1. Go to **User Menu** > **Personal Details**.  \n   ![Passkey for Appdome - User menu personal details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/UserMenuPersonalDetails-1-321x731.png)\n2. Under **Login Details**, click **Add Passkey**.  \n   ![Passkey for Appdome -Fill personal details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FillPersonalDetails-1-1108x731.png)  \n   If your device is a Mac computer, the dialog box shown below appears. Proceed to the next step.  \n   ![Passkey for Appdome -Mac initial](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MacInitial.png)  \n   If your device is a Windows computer, skip to step 4.\n3. **When working on a Mac computer, choose any of the following options:**  \n   \u2013 Using an external device (phone or tablet)  \n   \u2013 Creating a passkey that will only be saved on this device  \n   \u2013 Inserting a security key\n   1. **To use an external device:**\n      1. Click Use a phone or tablet.\n      2. Use the external device\u2019s camera to scan the QR code on the dialog box that appears now.  \n         ![Passkey for Appdome -Passkey on other device](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PasskeyOnOtherDevice.png)\n   2. **To create a dedicated passkey for the device**:\n      1. Click **This device**.\n      2. Use the dialog box that appears now to create a passkey by clicking **Continue**.  \n         ![Passkey for Appdome -on qa Dev](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PasskeyOnQA-Dev.png)\n      3. Enter your password or use a built-in sensor (Touch ID) to verify your identity within Chrome.  \n         ![Passkey for Appdome -Chrome verification](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ChromeVerification.png)  \n         A notification appears to approve that the verification completed successfully.\n   3. **To use a physical security key**:\n      1. Click **USB security key**.\n      2. When prompted, insert your external security key and touch it.  \n         ![Passkey for Appdome -Security keys](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SecurityKeys.png)\n4. **When working on a Windows computer, the dialog box shown below appears.**  \n   ![Passkey for Appdome -Windows passkey create a passkey](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WindowsPasskey01-5.png)  \n   You can choose between any of the following options:  \n   \u2013 An external security key or built-in sensor  \n   \u2013 An existing, configured device  \n   \u2013 An external device\n   1. If your computer does not have a built-in sensor (for example, fingerpring or facial recognition), selecting the option **External security key or built-in sensor** invokes a dialog box that prompts you to insert a physical security key.  \n      ![Passkey for Appdome -Windows passkey keep record of visit](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WindowsPasskey02-1.png)  \n      You are now prompted to verify your identity.  \n      ![Passkey for Appdome -Windows passkey verify identity](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WindowsPasskey02a-1.png)\n   2. If you have an existing, configured device on your environment (in this example, OnePlus 8 pro), clicking the device name\u00a0sends a notification to your device.  \n      ![Passkey for Appdome -Windows passkey check your device ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WindowsPasskey04.png)  \n      The notification prompts you to click **Continue** to create a passkey.  \n      ![Passkey for Appdome -Existing device create a passkey](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ExistingDevice-3-332x731.jpg)\n   3. If you would like to create a passkey by using an external device, click the option Use a different phone or tablet to invoke\u00a0a dialog box with a QR code that you need to scan with the device where you would like to create the passkey.  \n      ![Passkey for Appdome -create passkey on another device](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WindowsPasskey05.png)  \n      After you successfully scan the code, the device\u2019s passkey is added as a cross-platform passkey.  \n      ![Passkey for Appdome -passkey added as a cross-platform passkey](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WindowsPasskey06.png)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use and Customize App Compromise Notifications](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appdome-basics/app-compromise-notification/)\n* [Structure of an iOS App Binary (.ipa)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appdome-basics/structure-of-an-ios-app-binary-ipa/)\n* [Structure of an Android App Binary (.apk)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appdome-basics/structure-of-an-android-app-binary-apk/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nThe description above is designed to help you perform Passkey Authentication on Appdome.

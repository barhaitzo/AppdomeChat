Once installed, it acts as adware, displaying intrusive ads and potentially harvesting sensitive user data. Hiddad primarily repackages genuine applications and redistributes them, compromising the security of the user\u2019s device. This malware can exploit various services, including permissions to access contacts, SMS, storage, and network settings, allowing it to download additional payloads or leak personal information. Additionally, Hiddad may bypass security measures by abusing Android\u2019s accessibility services, making it more challenging to remove. The primary aim of Hiddad is to generate revenue for cybercriminals through aggressive advertising and unauthorized data collection.\n\n## How Does Appdome Protect Against Hiddad?\n\nTaking all the above into consideration, you can use Appdome to protect against Hiddad using a combination of following protection methods:\n\n1. **[RASP](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/)** \u2013 Prevents Hiddad from injecting itself into installed apps and repackaging them.\n2.

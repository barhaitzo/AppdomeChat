With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida. For details, see [How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## General\n\nSauceLabs allows testing apps by using its Live and Automation testing suits. Both can be used to test Appdome-secured mobile apps.\n\nThe following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered and the reason why.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome Feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Detect App is Debuggable | SauceLabs signs the app as debuggable upon installation. | The app will acknowledge the debuggable state but will continue operating normally during the testing process. |\n| Detect Developer Options | Required to interact with the device | The app will detect this but will not crash, allowing testing to continue. |\n| Block Android Debug Bridge (ADB) | Required to interact with the device | The app will detect ADB usage but will not crash, ensuring smooth testing. |\n| Prevent App Screen Sharing | SauceLabs performs screen recording, so if this feature is enabled, all test videos will show a black screen. | The app will recognize the screen recording but will continue running without crashing. |\n| Prevent Keystroke Injection | SauceLabs uses adb command to enter text. | The app will detect the use of keystroke injection but will continue running without crashing, allowing for uninterrupted testing. |\n| Keylogging Prevention | Testing scripts that simulate inputs in a way that resembles keylogging might trigger this feature. | The app will detect potential keylogging behavior but will not crash. |\n| Detect OS Remount | To detect unauthorized changes to the system files, which could indicate security vulnerabilities. | The app will recognize OS remounts but will not crash, allowing testing to progress without interruption. |\n| Detect Fake GPS App | To prevent the use of applications that can spoof geographical locations and potentially mislead app functions or tests | The app will detect the usage of fake GPS apps but will continue running, allowing tests to be completed. |\n| Block GameGuardian | Prevents unauthorized game manipulation and cheating. | Build2Test ensures that the app blocks GameGuardian attempts while allowing testing to continue. |\n\n## **Live Mobile App Testing \u2013 Android**\n\n**To initiate Live App test of your test app in Saucelabs**:\n\n1. After successfully building and signing your app on Appdome, [**log in to your Saucelabs account**](https://app.saucelabs.com/).\u00a0Alternatively, if you do not yet have an account, [**create an account**](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up).  \n   **Note:**\n\n   For .aab app types, please refer to section\u00a0**Automate App testing \u2013 Android** before building the app on Appdome.\n2. On the left sidebar, select **App Management**.  \n   If you see an option to select\u00a0between devices on a Virtual Cloud and Real Devices, select\u00a0**Real Devices**. **![Appmanagement 12png 1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/appmanagement-12png-1-1.png)**A\u00a0list of your apps will be displayed.  \n   If you have not uploaded any app before, the list will be empty.  \n\n   If your test\u00a0app does not appear in the above list, you can upload it by dragging the app, or by\u00a0clicking\u00a0****choose file****. **![Appmanagement 12png 1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/appmanagement-12png-1-2.png)**\n3. After you upload your test app, hover your mouse or cursor over it to display the\u00a0**Settings and App Versions**option.  \n   ![Settings And App Versions3](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Settings-and-App-Versions3.png)\n4. Click\u00a0**Settings and App Versions**.\n5. Disable\u00a0*Instrumentation*and\u00a0*Image Injection*, thus preventing Saucelabs from re-signing the app.\n6. Click **App Management**.  \n   ![Appmanagementtab](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AppManagementTab.png)\n7. Hover your mouse or cursor over the app to display the **Start Test** option.\n8. Click\u00a0**Start Test**\u00a0to select the test device.  \n   ![Starttestbutton.5](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/StartTestButton.5.png)\n9. Select an available test device from the displayed list and click\u00a0**Launch**.  \n   This will start a manual test of the uploaded app on the selected device.  \n   ![Selectedandroiddevice](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SelectedAndroidDevice.png)  \n   To see live device logs, click **Log** on the menu on the right.  \n   ![Logmenuright](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LogMenuRight-867x731.png)\n10. When Done, click\u00a0**STOP** on the right menu.\n\nIf you want to test using Appium, check out the\u00a0[SauceLabs Appium Wiki.](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Getting+Started+with+Appium+for+Mobile+Application+Testing)\n\n## Automate App testing \u2013 Android\n\nThe following Appium capabilities, which are being used in the automation test code, can also trigger protection features:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **SauceLabs Specific Appium Capability** | **Reason** |\n| networkCapture | Saucelabs will re-sign the app |\n| resigningEnabled | Saucelabs will re-sign the app |\n| saucelaLabsImageInjectionEnabled | Saucelabs will re-sign the app |\n| saucelaLabsBypassScreenshotsRestriction | Saucelabs will re-sign the app |\n\n**Note:**\n\nTo avoid app re-signing by Saucelabs, it is required to disable the\u00a0**Instrumentation\u00a0and****Image Injection feature**on Saucelabs cloud.\n\nFor additional measures to take during app build on Appdome, see above sections **General** and **Testing .aab apps**.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on Browserstack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-on-browserstack/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on Browserstack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/test-appdome-secured-ios-apps-by-using-browserstack/)\n* [Test Appdome-secured Android Apps by Using Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-android-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [Testing Secured iOS Apps by Using Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [Testing Secured Android Apps by Using BitBar](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-using-bitbar/)\n* [How to test iOS apps by using Bitbar](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-ios-apps-by-using-bitbar/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1679322760586.1679391001880.3&__hssc=267077713.3.1679391001880&__hsfp=2327634395)!

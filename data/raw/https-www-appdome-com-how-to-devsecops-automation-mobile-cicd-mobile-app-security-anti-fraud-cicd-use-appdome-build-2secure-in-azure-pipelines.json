Appdome\u2019s Build-2Secure extension for Azure is an out-of-the-box Azure CI/CD integration, making it easy for mobile developers to secure Android & iOS apps in Azure CI/CD pipelines. Automate the build, signing, and certification of security, anti-fraud, and other protections in Android & iOS apps in Azure CI/CD pipelines. No code and no SDKs are required.\n\nThe purpose of Appdome\u2019s Build-2Secure extension for Azure is to streamline and accelerate cyber and anti-fraud delivery\u00a0in CI/CD pipelines. To do this, the\u00a0Build-2Secure extension for Azure automates three important steps in delivering more secure mobile applications to your users fast: (1) building the selected app-level protections into mobile apps, (2) code signing the Appdome-protected mobile app, and (3) certifying the defenses inside each Appdome-protected mobile app. The\u00a0Appdome\u00a0Build-2Secure\u00a0extension for Azure\u00a0is used to deliver\u00a0[Certifed Secure](https://www.appdome.com/certified-secure-mobile-devsecops-certification/)\u2122\u00a0mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile anti-bot, and other cyber defense updates in mobile apps on\u00a0[Appdome\u2019s Cyber Defense Automation Platform](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-cicd-system/). Use this\u00a0extension for Azure as a stand-alone\u00a0DevSecOps integration\u00a0or in combination\u00a0with other DevSecOps integrations in your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nFor more general information on this extension, see \u2018[What is Azure pipelines?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops)\u2018 on the Azure website.  \nHere are the step-by-step instructions on using the Appdome Build-2Secure extension for Azure. Enjoy!\n\n## Prerequisites:\n\n1. An [Appdome SRM account](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-release-management/)\n2. [Appdome API token](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-and-resetting-your-api-token)\n3. [Fusion-Set ID](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-a-fusion-sets-id)\n4. An [Azure Devops account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops)\n5. Review [Network Requirements](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/mobile-appsec-cicd/network-endpoints-requirements-for-appdome/) for Using Appdome Build-2Secure API\n\n## Step 1: Getting Started with Build-2Secure Extension for Azure\n\nAzure Pipelines automatically builds and tests code projects. It supports all major languages and project types and combines\u00a0[continuous integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops#continuous-integration),\u00a0[continuous delivery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops#continuous-delivery), and\u00a0[continuous testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops#continuous-testing) to build, test, and deliver your code to any destination.\n\nThe Appdome Build-2Secure extension takes the unprotected application file (apk, aab or ipa), rebuilds the file, and signs it by using the On-Appdome platform, based on the selected fusion set and signature method. This step can be performed either as part of an existing pipeline or as a new pipeline where you must provide the application file as part of the input for this step.\n\nIf you already have an existing pipeline, you can skip to Step 3.\n\n## Step 2: Installing Build-2Secure Extension for Azure\n\nFollow the steps below to install the Appdome Extension from the Azure DevOps Marketplace.\n\n1. Go to\u00a0[Azure DevOps marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)\u00a0> **Azure Devops** tab.\n2.

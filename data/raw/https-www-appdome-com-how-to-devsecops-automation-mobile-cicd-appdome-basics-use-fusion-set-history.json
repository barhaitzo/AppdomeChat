Click\u00a0**Annotate Changes**\u00a0to display the dialog box shown below.  \n   The upper part of this dialog box displays the number of the most recent version.  \n   ![Annotate Changes - fusion set history](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fusion-set-annotaition-1.png)\n2. Enter another number (integer only \u2013 not 2.a or 2.1). Alternatively, keep the current number.\n3. Use the lower part to enter text (up to 250 characters).  \n   ![Fusion Set Annotaition2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fusion-set-annotaition2.png)\n4. Click **Save**.  \n   The **Annotate Changes** progress bar provides a visual indication of the change addition process.\n5. Click **Build My App**.\n\nWhen the build process completes and (optionally) after adding a context, the new version of the Fusion Set will be available in the **Fusion Set Summary** tab.\n\n## Reviewing The Fusion Set Summary Tab\n\n**To review the\u00a0Fusion Set Summary Tab:**\n\n1. Select the requested Fusion Set.\n2. Click **Details** (\u2026).\n3. Click **Fusion Set History**.  \n   ![Fusion Set History Tab](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fusion-set-history-tab-1-551x366.png)  \n   Each Fusion Set version is displayed in a separate row, with the most recently created Fusion Set version at the top.  \n   For each version you can see, under the **Services** column, the services enabled as a result of creating the version.  \n   To see the full text of the annotation made when creating the version, hover the mouse on the text under the **Annotation** column.\n\n## Comparing Between Fusion Set Details\n\nYou can use the **Fusion Set History** tab to compare between various versions of the Fusion Set.\n\n**To compare between versions:**\n\n1. Position the cursor on the requested version\u2019s row to select it.\n2. Go to the rightmost side of the row.\n3. Click the **Compare Version** button.  \n   ![Compareversionbutton](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CompareVersionButton.png)  \n   The dialog box displayed upon clicking this button shows the selected version on the right, and allows you to select the requested version from all currently existing versions on the left.  \n   ![Version Comparison - fusion set history](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Version-comparison-551x366.png)\n4. Click to select the version to which you would like to compare.  \n   As seen in the image below, when a version is selected (left image), a list is displayed (right image) to show all changes made between the two versions, namely: which features were enabled (highlighted in green and disabled (highlighted in red).  \n   ![Annotation Of Another Fusion ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Annotation-of-another-Fusion-.png)\n\n## Fusion Set History per License\n\nThe availability of Fusion Set History varies depending on your license level:\n\n* **Go**: Versions are available for up to 30 days.\n* **Dev**: Versions are available for up to 90 days.\n* **Dev+**: Versions are available for up to 180 days.\n* **SRM**: Versions are available for up to 360 days.\n* **With SRM-C**: Versions are available indefinitely.\n\n## Creating New Fusion Sets From a Specific Version\n\nBy default, all new Fusion Sets are created within the topmost branch. In addition, you can create new Fusion Sets from a previous version, thus turning the selected version into an independent Fusion Set.\n\n**Note**:\n\nThis process should be repeated each time you need to create a new Fusion Set based on any version other than the default (topmost) version.\n\n**To\u00a0create a new Fusion Set from a specific version:**\n\n1. Position the cursor on the requested version\u2019s row to select it.\n2. Go to the rightmost side of the row.\n3. Click the\u00a0button shown in the figure below.  \n   ![Createnewversionbutton](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CreateNewVersionButton-1.png)\n\n## Related articles:\n\n* [How to Manage Fusion Set Security Templates iOS/Android](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/create-mobile-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n* [How to Release Mobile App Security Templates between Teams](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/security-release-management/releasing-fusion-sets/)\n* [How to Freeze-Lock Mobile App Protection Templates for Android & iOS RCs in DevSecOps Build System](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/freeze-lock-moible-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-rcs-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [**support.appdome.com**](http://support.appdome.com/) or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

By integrating these threat events into your SDK, you can detect and respond to various security threats, ensuring that the applications using your SDK are secure.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure that you have the following:\n\n* An iOS SDK project set up in Xcode.\n* The SDK XCFramework is integrated into your project.\n* An iOS xcframework.zip file\n* Basic knowledge of Objective-C or Swift programming.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. Integrate the SDK XCFramework\n\nEnsure that your SDK XCFramework is properly set up.\n\n#### 2. Modify the SDK\u2019s Info.plist File\n\nThe *`Info.plist`* File in your SDK needs to be configured to specify the threat events your SDK will handle and the receiver class that will process these events.\n\n1. Open project\n2. Click on the info tab\n3. Click the + symbol\n4. Add classes\n\nAdd the following keys and values to your SDK\u2019s *`Info.plist`* File:\n\n`ThreatEventNames`: A comma-separated list of threat events that the SDK will monitor.\n\n`ThreatEventReceiver`: The class within your SDK that will handle these threat events.\n\n![Create Info.plist](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Creat-info.plist_-1300x375.png)\n\n#### 3. Implement the Threat Event Receiver in Your SDK\n\nCreate or modify the class within your SDK that will handle the threat events. This class should conform to the expected interface provided by your SDK. Here\u2019s an example implementation in Objective-C:\n\nThe following code provides the implementation for the `<Appdome_ADThreatManager_Example>`\u00a0Class, which will handle threat events. This class should be part of your SDK.\n\n**Note:** Replace all class name instances labed `<Appdome_ADThreatManager_Example>`\u00a0with the specific name of your class listener name. This is crucial to ensure your code functions correctly with the intended event data.\n\n**ADThreatManager.h**\n\n```\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h> @interface <Appdome_ADThreatManager_Example> : NSObject\r\n- (void)onNotification:(NSNotification *)notification;\r\n@end\n```\n\n**ADThreatManager.m**\n\n```\n@implementation <Appdome_ADThreatManager_Example>\r\n- (void)onNotification:(NSNotification *)notification {\r\nNSLog(@\"<Appdome_ADThreatManager_Example>::notification received: %@\", notification);\r\n}\r\n@end\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n\n* `<Appdome_ADThreatManager_Example>` is a class that inherits from `NSObject`.\n* It has a method `onNotification:` which logs received notifications.\n\n### Meta-Data for Mobile SDK Threat-Events\n\nBelow is the list of metadata that can be associated with each mobile SDK built with an XCFramework.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Context Key** | **Reason** |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running SDK. |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version, and machine. |\n| reasonData | Reason for the attack. For example, root detection. |\n| defaultMessage | A pre-defined message that will be displayed to the SDK or logged when a specific event occurs. |\n| message | A message will be displayed to the SDK when an event occurs. |\n| timestamp | The exact date and time when the event occurred are recorded in a standard timestamp format. |\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively integrate and use SDK Input Threat Events to protect your mobile SDKs in iOS XCFrameworks. This setup will help your SDK detect and respond to security threats, enhancing the overall security of applications that integrate your SDK.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Obfuscate SDK Logic using Appdome SDKProtect\u2122](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/protect-your-sdk-with-appdome/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1720105402732.1720113808867.35&__hssc=79098507.1.1720113808867&__hsfp=2459653256)\n* [How to Use Appdome SDKProtect to Secure Mobile SDKs](/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/use-appdome-sdk-protection-for-mobile-apps/)\n* [Automated SDK Protection \u2013 Appdome SDKProtect\u2122](/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/step-by-step-guide-to-securing-mobile-sdks-with-appdomes-sdk-protect/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1720105402732.1720113808867.35&__hssc=79098507.1.1720113808867&__hsfp=2459653256)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.4813e3c14dfd72c536ccb23ddc37f504.1718886661975.1720105402732.1720113808867.35&__hssc=79098507.1.1720113808867&__hsfp=2459653256)!

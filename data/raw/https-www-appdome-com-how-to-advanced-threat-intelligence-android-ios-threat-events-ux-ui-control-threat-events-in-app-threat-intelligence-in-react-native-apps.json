This allows them to (1) ensure that mobile application workflows are aware of attacks and threats, (2) customize business logic and user experience based on the user\u2019s risk profile and/or each attack or threat presented, and (3) pass the threat data to other record systems, such as app servers, mobile fraud analysis systems, SIEMs, and other data collection points.\n\nThe purpose of Threat-Events is to enable Android and iOS applications to adapt and respond to mobile app attacks and threats in real-time. Using Threat-Events will ensure the safety of users, data, and transactions.\n\n### Mobile Application Threat-Events vs. Threat-Scores\n\nAppdome Threat Events can be used as a stand-alone implementation in React Native Apps or in combination with Threat Scores. Threat Events provide the mobile developer with the in-app notification of each attack or threat and the metadata associated with the attack. Threat Scores provide the mobile developer with the Threat Event\u00a0event score and the combined (aggregate) mobile end-user risk at the time of the notification.\n\nThe figure below shows where you can find Threat-Events and Threat-Scores for each of the runtime mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile antibot, and other protections available on Appdome:\n\n[![Threat Intelligence in React Native Apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/55-1-1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/55-1-1.png)\n\nTo enable Threat-Events with any runtime protection, select the check box next to Threat-Events for that feature. Doing so will enable (turn ON) Threat-Events for that feature. To enable Threat-Scores for any runtime protection, click the up/down arrow associated with Threat-Scores to assign a specific score to each protection.  \nThreat-Scores must have a value greater than zero (0) and less than a thousand (1,000).\n\nThreat-Events and Threat-Scores can be used with or in place of server-based mobile anti-fraud solutions.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Threat-Events with React Native Apps\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to use Threat-Events with React Native Apps.\n\n* Appdome account (If you do not yet have an account,\u00a0[create a free Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)).\n* Appdome account class \u2013 Appdome DEV or higher.\n* Mobile Application Source Code.\n* [Threat events license](/appdome-pricing/)\n* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)\u00a0software\n* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)\u00a0software\n* [React-Native\u00a0mobile development framework](http://www.reactnative.com/)\n* Signing Credentials (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile) \u2013 see [Signing Secure Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [Signing Secure iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/).\n\n### Code Snippet Required for\u00a0Using Threat-Events with React Native Apps\n\nBefore consuming Threat-Events or Threat-Scores in your React Native Apps, confirm that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Threat-Events and/or Threat-Scores have been enabled (turned ON) for the specific protection\n* You are using the correct identifiers for the Threat-Events for each protection.  \n  You can find the specific identifiers for each Threat-Event and Threat-Score in the knowledge base article associated with each protection.\n\nUsing Threat-Events\u2122 and Threat-Scores\u2122 in React Native Apps is different between iOS and Android.\n\n#### Below is the code snippet required for using Threat-Events\u2122 and Threat-Scores\u2122 in iOS React Native Apps\n\n1. Open the iOS project in Xcode (resides in IOS folder under the root directory of the project).\n2. Add an **ADThreatEvents** class and an **ADThreatEvents**\u00a0header.\n3. Make the **ADThreatEvents**\u00a0class inherit from **RCTEventEmitter** and implements **RCTBridgeModule**.  \n   The **ADThreatEvents**header should contain the following code:\n\n   ```\n   #ifndef ADThreatEvents_h\r\n   #define ADThreatEvents_h \r\n   \r\n   #import \"React/RCTBridgeModule.h\"\r\n   #import <React/RCTEventEmitter.h>\r\n   \r\n   @interface ADThreatEvents : RCTEventEmitter \r\n   @property (strong) NSMutableArray *supportedEventsArray; \r\n   @end \r\n   \r\n   #endif/* ADThreatEvents_h */\r\n   ```\n4. Add the following code to **ADThreatEvents** class\n\n   ```\n   #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\r\n   #import \"ADThreatEvents.h\"\r\n   #import \"React/RCTBridgeModule.h\"\r\n   \r\n   @implementation ADThreatEvents\r\n   RCT_EXPORT_MODULE()\r\n   // This method can be called from js to register to event\r\n   RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(registerForThreatEvent:(NSString *)name ) {\r\n       [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(handleNotification:) name:name object:nil];\r\n       if (!self.supportedEventsArray) {\r\n           self.supportedEventsArray = [NSMutableArray array];\r\n       }\r\n       [self.supportedEventsArray addObject:name];\r\n   }\r\n   \r\n   // This method is needed to return all the events that will be called using sendEventWithName\r\n   - (NSArray *)supportedEvents\r\n   {\r\n       return self.supportedEventsArray;\r\n   }\r\n   \r\n   // This method will send notification to js\r\n   - (void)handleNotification:(NSNotification *)notification\r\n   { \r\n       [self sendEventWithName:notification.name body:notification.userInfo];\r\n   }\r\n   @end\r\n   ```\n\n   ```\n   To register for Threat-Events, see the section Threat-Event Registration for\n   ```\n\n   **iOS and Android React Native Apps**\n\n   ```\n   .\n   ```\n\n### Below is the code snippet required for using Threat-Events\u2122 and Threat-Scores\u2122 in Android React Native Apps:\n\n1. Open the Android project in Android Studio (it resides in the Android folder under the root directory).  \n   Add **ADThreatEvents** class with the following code:\n\n   ```\n   package com.reactnativedevevents;\r\n   \r\n   import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;\r\n   import android.content.Context;\r\n   import android.content.Intent;\r\n   import android.content.IntentFilter;\r\n   import android.os.Bundle;\r\n   import android.util.Log;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.bridge.Arguments;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContextBaseJavaModule;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactMethod;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReadableMap;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.bridge.WritableMap;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.modules.core.DeviceEventManagerModule;\r\n   import javax.annotation.Nonnull;\r\n   \r\n   public class ADDevEvents extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\r\n   \r\n       public class ThreatEventReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {\r\n   \r\n           @Override\r\n           public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {\r\n               Log.i(\"Appdome\", \"recieved\");\r\n               handleNotification(intent);\r\n           }\r\n   \r\n           private void handleNotification(Intent intent) {\r\n               WritableMap extras = Arguments.fromBundle(intent.getExtras());\r\n               getReactApplicationContext()\r\n                       .getJSModule(DeviceEventManagerModule.RCTDeviceEventEmitter.class)\r\n                       .emit(intent.getAction(), extras);\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n       private ThreatEventReceiver threatEventReceiver = new ThreatEventReceiver();\r\n   \r\n       public ADDevEvents(@Nonnull ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\r\n           super(reactContext);\r\n       }\r\n   \r\n       @Nonnull\r\n       @Override\r\n       public String getName() {\r\n           return \"ADDevEvents\";\r\n       }\r\n   \r\n       @ReactMethod\r\n       public void registerForDevEvent(String action) {\r\n           IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter(action);\r\n           Log.i(\"Appdome\", \"registered\");\r\n           if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU) {\r\n              this.getReactApplicationContext().registerReceiver(threatEventReceiver, filter, Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED);\r\n           } else {\r\n              this.getReactApplicationContext().registerReceiver(threatEventReceiver, filter);\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n   \r\n       @ReactMethod\r\n       public void postDevEvent(String action, ReadableMap userInfo) {\r\n           Intent intent = new Intent(action);\r\n           if (userInfo != null) {\r\n               Bundle bundle = Arguments.toBundle(userInfo);\r\n               intent.putExtras(bundle);\r\n           }\r\n           this.getReactApplicationContext().sendBroadcast(intent);\r\n       }\r\n   }\n   ```\n2. Add **ADThreatEvents****Package** class with the following code:\n\n   ```\n   import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManager;\r\n   import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n   import java.util.Collections;\r\n   import java.util.List;\r\n   import javax.annotation.Nonnull;\r\n   \r\n   public class ADThreatEventsPackage implements ReactPackage {\r\n       @Nonnull\r\n       @Override\r\n       public List createNativeModules(@Nonnull ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\r\n           List modules = new ArrayList<>();\r\n           modules.add(new ADThreatEvents(reactContext));\r\n           return modules;\r\n       }\r\n   \r\n       @Nonnull\r\n       @Override\r\n       public List createViewManagers(@Nonnull ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\r\n           return Collections.emptyList();\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\n3. Append the newly created **ADThreatEventsPackage()**\u00a0class to **getPackages** method in **MainApplication** class.  \n   Here is an example of the **MainApplication** class code:\n\n   ```\n   import android.app.Application;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage;\r\n   import com.facebook.react.shell.MainReactPackage;\r\n   import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader;\r\n   import java.util.Arrays;\r\n   import java.util.List;\r\n   \r\n   public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {\r\n   \r\n       private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new ReactNativeHost(this) {\r\n           @Override\r\n           public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {\r\n           return BuildConfig.DEBUG;\r\n           }\r\n   \r\n           @Override\r\n           protected List getPackages() {\r\n               return Arrays.asList(new MainReactPackage(), new ADThreatEventsPackage());\r\n           }\r\n   \r\n           @Override\r\n           protected String getJSMainModuleName() {\r\n               return \"index\";\r\n           }\r\n       };\r\n   \r\n       @Override\r\n       public ReactNativeHost getReactNativeHost() {\r\n           return mReactNativeHost;\r\n       }\r\n   \r\n       @Override\r\n       public void onCreate() {\r\n           super.onCreate();\r\n           SoLoader.init(this,/* native exopackage */ false);\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\n\n   To register for Threat-Events, see the section **Threat-Event Registration for** **iOS and Android React Native Apps**.\n\n### Threat-Event Registration for iOS and Android React Native Apps\n\n1. 1. 1. Add **NativeModules** and **NativeEventEmitter** from *react-native*.\n         1. Add the following code:\n\n            ```\n            const { ADThreatEvents } = NativeModules;\r\n            const adThreatEvents = new NativeEventEmitter(ADThreatEvents);\r\n            ```\n         2. Add the following function:\n\n            ```\n            function registerToThreatEvent(action, callback) {\r\n                NativeModules.ADThreatEvents.registerForThreatEvent(action);\r\n                adThreatEvents.addListener(action, callback);\r\n            }\r\n            ```\n      2. Register for a Threat-Events by calling **registerToThreatEvent(action, callback)** from JS.\n\n### Special Considerations for Using Threat Events with React Native Apps\n\nReactNative does not provide an out-of-the-box method to register to receive broadcasts or NSNotifications from JavaScript.\n\nTo enable receiving these broadcasts, the following operations should be performed within the ReactNative app:\n\n1. Implement Java\\Kotlin class that registers a BroadcastReceiver or Objective-C class, depending on the platform, to add an OS-specific handler that will receive a ThreatEvent.\n2. Declare the class that registers a ThreatEvent receiver as a package, and register this package to make it accessible from ReactNative\u2019s Webview by using JavaScript.\n3. Register handlers for all protections configured as ThreatEvent from Java Script.\n\n**Compatibility with Android 14**\n\nFollowing a security update introduced in Android 14 (API level 34), apps targeting Android 14 are required to explicitly specify whether a registered receiver should be exported to all other apps on the device.  \nA Security exception will be raised if a context-registered broadcast receiver is registered without passing either Context.RECEIVER\\_NOT\\_EXPORTED or Context.RECEIVER\\_EXPORTED.  \nThe receiver flags were introduced in Android 13 as part of\u00a0 \u201cSafer exporting of context-registered receivers\u201d.\u00a0 Therefore when registering a broadcast receiver for Threat Events, the call to register a a context-registered\u00a0 BroadcastReceiver registration should include the Context.RECEIVER\\_NOT\\_EXPORTED receiver flag when the app targets Android 13 and above in order to ensure that the receiver will only accept broadcasts sent from within the protected app.  \nFor additional details, please refer to this Android guide:  \n[Android Developers Features and APIs Overview:\u00a0 Safer exporting of context-registered receivers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/features#runtime-receivers). [Android Developers Broadcasts overview: Context-registered receivers](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts#context-registered-receivers)\n\n### Meta-Data for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nBelow is the list of metadata that can be associated with each mobile application, Threat-Event, and Threat-Score, in React Native Apps.\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| carrierPlmn | PLMN of the device. Only available for Android devices. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| deviceBrand | Brand of the device |\n| deviceBoard | Board of the device |\n| buildUser | Build user |\n| buildHost | Build host |\n| sdkVersion | Sdk version |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n\nSome or all of the meta-data for\u00a0each mobile application Threat-Event\u00a0and Threat-Score can be consumed in React Native\u00a0Apps at the discretion of the mobile developer and used, in combination with other mobile application data, to adapt the business logic or user experience when one or more attacks or threats are present.\n\n### Using Conditional Enforcement for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nConditional Enforcement is an extension to Appdome\u2019s mobile application Threat-Event framework. By using conditional enforcement, developers can control when Appdome enforcement of each mobile application protection takes place or invoke backup, failsafe, and enforcement to any in-app enforcement used by the mobile developer.\n\n### Verifying Threat Events in React Native Apps\n\nAfter you have implemented the required Threat-Event code in your React Native\u00a0Apps, you can confirm that your Threat-Event implementation(s) is properly recognized by the Appdome protections in the React Native\u00a0Apps.

When enabled, your SecurePWA app will only be able to access trusted domains and sites.\n\n## About Appdome SecurePWA\n\nAppdome SecurePWA is a no-code mobile development tool that enables anyone to build secure Android and iOS progressive web apps (PWAs) that run as native or cross-platform Android and iOS apps on any mobile device \u2013 instantly, with no code or coding. The only requirement needed to create a Secure PWA is the URL of any existing website, web app, or cloud app. Developers or non-developers use Appdome\u2019s simple \u2018click to create\u2019 user interface to build a progressive web application from any responsive website and add a wide variety of mobile security, SDKs, and APIs to their newly created Android and iOS apps in minutes \u2013 also with no code or coding.\n\nThe end result is a brand-new iOS, Android, or cross-platform app built entirely from scratch in seconds. Once the new app is created, customers instantly secure the app by selecting their choice of Appdome Mobile App Security features to build in the required security model directly into the app \u2013 all within the same no-code workflow.\n\nAppdome offers SecurePWA as part of\u202f[Appdome-DEV](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/).\u202f SecurePWA dramatically accelerates enterprise mobile strategies. Organizations build genuine mobile apps from websites in minutes and offer users easy and persistent mobile app access to digital resources, offline use, and more, all with the confidence of the enterprise security model chosen by the organization.\n\n**SiteTrust\u2122**\n\n* Protects non-public resources by restricting access/navigation to the home domain only.\n* When enabled, the app will only be able to access trusted domains and sites.\n* To enable access to protected resources, see \u202fthe AUTHENTICATION section for advanced authentication services.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Appdome\u2019s SecurePWA\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Appdome-DEV access](/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/use-devsecops-build-system-to-secure-mobile-apps-at-scale/)\n* A website address that is accessible from a mobile browser\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## How to Convert Any Website Into a Secure Progressive Web App (PWA)\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to convert any website into a PWA.\n\n1. Navigate to the **Add App** tab\n2. Select **Create SecurePWA\u2122**\n3. Enter the **website address**\u00a0(please validate that the website address is correct and reachable).\n4. Choose your **App Name**\n5. Choose the **App platform**: iOS, Android or both\n6. For the iOS platform \u2013 upload the **Provisioning Profile**.\n7.

(optional) **Dev settings** \u2013 configure the app version and version code\n\n![Welcome To Secure Pwa](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/welcome-to-secure-PWA-1.png)\n\n1. **SiteTrust** \u2013 (included by default)\u00a0 protects non-public resources by restricting access/navigation to the home domain only.\n\n![Pwa2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PWA2-1.png)\n\n**Congratulations!** You now have converted your website to a progressive web app. You can find your PWA in your Appdome account (left navigation menu) with all the other app binaries that you\u2019ve previously added to your account.\n\n![Success](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Success.png)\n\n## After Building Your PWA\n\nAfter you have converted your website to a PWA, you need to move your PWA through the [Appdome workflow](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-fuse-an-app-end-to-end/). Just like with any other app that you build and secure using Appdome, click on the newly created PWA in your account, then select the services and security features you wish to implement in your PWA. Then click Build My App.\n\nThe minimum set of services required to secure your PWA is [ONEShield by Appdome.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/fusing-apps-with-oneshield-by-appdome/)(Appdome\u2019s no-code App shielding/hardening solution).\u00a0 ONEShield prevents tampering,\u00a0 malicious reverse engineering, debugging and any other unauthorized changes to your new PWA.\u00a0 After building ONEShield into your app, you will now have a Secure PWA.\n\nAfter you finish building your SecurePWA on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your project, including signing your app.\n\nCheck out this KB on [Completing My Appdome Project \u2013 final steps](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-complete-your-mobile-app-integration-project-after-integrating-your-mobile-app-on-appdome/)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Open Non App URLs In Native Browser With Secure PWA](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-mobile-work/secure-progressive-web-apps/open-non-app-urls-in-native-browser-with-secure-pwa/)\n* [How To Use Open-in to Launch a Mobile App From Your Secure PWA](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-mobile-work/secure-progressive-web-apps/use-open-in-to-launch-a-mobile-app-from-your-secure-pwa/)\n* [How to Make a Secure PWA Open Target URLs In Native Browser](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/securing-mobile-work/secure-progressive-web-apps/make-a-secure-pwa-open-target-urls-in-native-browser/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1679322760586.1679391001880.3&__hssc=267077713.3.1679391001880&__hsfp=2327634395)!

The data in the dashboard updates every hour, which means that security teams can track in real-time how attacks evolve and react quickly to emerging trends. There are no requirements or prerequisites needed, no API integrations are required from the operation teams, and no code changes are needed from the mobile development teams in order for attacks and threats that a protected app faces to appear in the dashboard. [Learn more about ThreatScope Mobile XTM.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-xdr/understanding-threatscope/)\n\n## Using Standard Views\n\nThe **Standard Views** menu on the left side panel allows you to easily filter and create custom views of the Threat Scope data.  \nWith the custom views and by using the **Advanced Filters**, security teams can zoom in on specific aspects of the threat data. Whether it\u2019s a particular app, a specific time frame, or a geographic region, Standard Views\u00a0enable granular analysis, which is essential for identifying patterns and trends in the mobile threats apps are facing.\n\n[![Standard Views Panel](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Standard-Views-Panel.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Standard-Views-Panel.png)\n\n### \n\n#### 1. Select the data display option \u2013 Either by Event Instances or Impacted Devices.\n\n[![Standard Views Options](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Standard_Views_options.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Standard_Views_options.png)\n\n**Events Instance:**Displays the data for all occurring events \u2013 each event instance is counted individually and the accumulated data is presented.\n\n**Impacted Devices:** Summarizes the number of unique devices any event occurred on. If one specific device experiences a certain event a number of times, it will still be counted as one device.\n\n#### 2. Select the data displayed from one of the following categories:\n\n[![All Attacks Button](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All_Attacks_Button.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/All_Attacks_Button.png)\n\n**All Attacks \u2013**\u00a0Displays all accumulated data by the number of individual events. If a specific device experiences several events of the same type, all events will be counted.\n\n[![App Defense Button](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/App_Defense_Button.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/App_Defense_Button.png)\n\n**App Defense \u2013** Displays all Appdome detections whether or not they are enforced on the client app or sent to the client app via Threat Events.\n\n[![Bot Defense Button](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bot_Defense_Button.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bot_Defense_Button.png)\n\n**Bot Defense Data \u2013** Access complete payload data from Appdome\u2019s MobileBOT\u2122 Defense (MBD) solution for insights on mobile infrastructure. Correlating and validating real attacks can detect and prevent attacks like credential stuffing and DDoS.\n\n[![Build2test Events Button](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Build2Test_Events_Button.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Build2Test_Events_Button.png)\n\n**Build2Test Events \u2013** This function summarizes\u00a0the Threat Events data only for apps built with the Build-to-Test feature. These apps are built specifically for testing via third-party vendors.  \n[Learn more about Appdome\u2019s Build-to-Test](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n\n#### 3. Filter the data\n\nYou can filter the data using each one of the following filters; you can combine filters to create unique Standard Views and gain further insight on the events your Appdome-built apps are facing.\n\nThe filters that can be used for controlling the displayed data are:\n\n* By Threats\n  + **Performance By** \u2013 The type of defense implemented in Threat Events.\n  + **Event Type** \u2013 The name of the protection on FAC.\n  + **Reason Code** \u2013 The Threat/Attack user-facing code from the mobile device. The reason code is used in the \u201cThreatScopeTM User Remediation Center\u201d to understand the specific events or metadata that triggered the threat. Customer support organizations can use this information to instruct the mobile user on how to remediate the threat and return to using the mobile app.\n* By Apps\n  + **Task ID** \u2013 The unique Build ID of the apps Appdome build.\n  + **App ID** \u2013 The unique ID for a protected app on FAC.\n  + **Bundle ID** \u2013\u00a0The app\u2019s identifier is listed in the **AndroidManifest.xml**\u00a0or\u00a0**Info.plist**\u00a0file.\n  + **Bundle Version** \u2013 The Specific version number of an app.\n* By Build\n  + **Team Type** \u2013 The type of the team that ran the app builds.\n  + **Account Name** \u2013 The name of the account plus the team type.\n  + **Fusion Set Name** \u2013 The name of the fusion set to which the protected app is subscribed.\n  + **Fusion Set ID** \u2013 The ID of the fusion set to which the protected app is subscribed.\n* By Platform\n  + **Manufacturer** \u2013 The device manufacturer associated with the detected attack.\n  + **OS** \u2013 The platform associated with the detected attack. Android / iOS\n  + **OS Version \u2013** The OS Version associated with the detected attack.\n  + **Country \u2013** For further information, see section Reviewing the geographical source of threats.\n\n#### 4. Create Custom Threat Views\n\nWhen the data is filtered, you can save it by creating a view.\n\n[![Standard Views](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Standard-Views.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Standard-Views.png)\n\nYou can access your custom Threat Views via the main drop-down menu.\n\n![Threatscope View](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ThreatScope-View.png)\n\n### Custom Threat View\u00a0options\n\n![Custom Views Edit](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/custom-views-edit-1.png) **Edit View Settings**\n\nEnables editing of the parameters of the Custom View.\n\n![Update View](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/update-view.png)\n\nAfter editing, you\u2019ll be able to update the current Custom Threat View by saving it.\n\n[![Save View](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Save-View-2.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Save-View-2.png)\n\nYou can also lock the Custom View to disable editing.\n\n![Unlock View](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/unlock-view-650x270.png)\n\n![Custom Views Copy](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/custom-views-copy-1.png) **Duplicate View**\n\nEnables duplication of the Custom Threat View.

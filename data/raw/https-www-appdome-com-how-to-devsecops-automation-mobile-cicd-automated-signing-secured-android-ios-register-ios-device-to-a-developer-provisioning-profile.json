This profile is designed to be used for development and testing. An app signed with this profile can only be installed on a pre-defined set of up to 100 devices assigned\u00a0to the apple developer id. It\u2019s not recommended to use an\u00a0\u201ciOS App Development\u201d provisioning profile for production deployment of mobile apps.\n\nIf you do sign your iOS app with an iOS App Development provisioning profile, and the app does not install on a device, one of the reasons could be that the device\u2019s ID is not in the list of device IDs included in the provisioning profile.\n\nThis knowledge base article shows you how to obtain your iOS device\u2019s ID and ensure that the device ID is in your iOS App Development provisioning profile.\n\n## How to Register iOS Devices to a Development Provisioning Profile\n\nFirst, you will have to find your device\u2019s UDUD (Unique device identifier)\n\n### How to find and iOS device\u2019s UDID:\n\n**Using iTunes (on Mac or PC):**\n\n1. Connect your device to a computer and turn on iTunes (the device may need to sync)\n2. Click the **Device** button.![Register iOS Devices to a Development Provisioning Profile](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/UDID_itunes_1-170x113.png)\n3. Click the words \u201c**Serial Number**\u201c.![Register iOS Devices to provisioning profile ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/UDID_itunes_2-170x112.png)\n4. The field is changed to device\u2019s\u00a0**UDID**\u00a0\u00a0![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/UDID_itunes_3-768x507.png)\n\n**Using Xcode (on Mac):**\n\n1. Connect the device to a Mac machine and turn on **Xcode.**\n2. Click Window \u2013> Devices and Simulators.![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/UDID_xcode_1-768x298.png)\n3. **UDID** appears in the **Identifier**field.![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/UDID_xcode_2-768x312.png)\n\nAlternatively, you can use a service like\u00a0<http://udid.io>, which installs a profile on the device and can retrieve\u00a0the UDID very easily.\n\nNow that you know the device\u2019s UDID, you need to find what devices are registered to the provisioning profile.\n\n### How to find and UDIDs registered to a\u00a0Development Provisioning Profile:\n\nIf you have access to the provisioning profile file itself, open it using a text editor and search for \u201c**<key>ProvisionedDevices</key>**\u201c. After this key, you will find an array of UDIDs registered to the profile:\n\n```\n    <array>\r\n        <string>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</string>\r\n        <string>yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy</string>\r\n        <string>zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</string>\r\n    </array>\r\n```\n\nIf you only have access to the signed app binary, you can extract the provisioning profile from the app file:\n\n1. **Unzip** the app file.\n2. Open the **Payload** folder.\n3. Open **<appname>.app** folder\n4. Open the file \u201c**embedded.mobileprovision**\u201d with a text editor and continue as above.\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [**support.appdome.com**](http://support.appdome.com/ \"http://support.appdome.com/\") or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

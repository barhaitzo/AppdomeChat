This Knowledge Base article provides an overview of Appdome\u2019s no-code security cloud service infrastructure, including the cloud security measures we put place in place to protect user accounts, apps, data and mobile integration projects. For more detailed information on this topic, please contact us directly.\n\nWe hope you find it useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## Appdome\u2019s No-Code Security Cloud Service Architecture Overview\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform, supporting a wide variety of implementations for Android and iOS apps. The Appdome platform is hosted on industry leading cloud infrastructures including AWS and Google Cloud.\n\nEach of these tech-giants guarantee a very high degree of availability, performance, security, failover and recovery services. This ensures consistent and continuous availability of our mobile integration platform to customers. We designed our environment to provide robustness, redundancy, reliability and durability. This supports customers performing integration projects on-demand, in parallel and at scale.\n\n### Why Appdome chose AWS to host its no-code security cloud service\n\nAppdome hosts its cloud-based platform on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) because AWS is:\n\n* **INTEGRATED** \u2013 Amazon [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is integrated with most AWS services such as Amazon\u00a0Simple Storage Service ([Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)), Amazon Relational Database Service ([Amazon\u00a0RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)), and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ([Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)) to provide a complete, secure\u00a0solution for computing, query processing, and cloud storage across a wide range of\u00a0applications.\n* **RELIABLE** \u2013 Amazon EC2 offers a highly reliable environment where replacement\u00a0instances can be rapidly and predictably provisioned. The service runs within\u00a0Amazon\u2019s proven network infrastructure and datacenters. The Amazon EC2 SLA commitment is 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 Region.\n* **SECURE** \u2013 Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, we benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of\u00a0the most security-sensitive organizations. Amazon EC2 works in conjunction with\u00a0Amazon VPC to provide security and robust networking functionality for our compute\u00a0resources.\n\n### AppDome AWS Infrastructure\n\n### Appdome Platform Security\n\nOur customers access the [Appdome Platform](https://fusion.appdome.com)\u00a0through a standard web browser. All connections establish HTTPS tunnels directly to Amazon\u2019s EC2. Appdome does not operate its own network and traffic does not traverse proxies.\u00a0As part of\u00a0Appdome\u2019s Cloud Infrastructure best practices, we leverage AWS security groups to protect access to EC2 and RDS. A security group acts as a firewall between accounts and different parts of Appdome\u2019s infrastructure. Our platform transmits mobile integration project data to MySQL over SSL. We never store user account passwords on Appdome. Instead, password hashes are stored via Password-Based Key Derivation Function. All data on Appdome\u2019s platform resides in\u00a0encrypted instances using industry standard AES-256 encryption. This ensures the protection of all data on the servers that host Appdome services.\n\n### Appdome Disaster Recovery\n\nAppdome also leverages AWS for disaster recovery. AWS provides robust and simple disaster recovery capabilities, enabling Appdome to backup & restore any data for any user account or mobile integration project. We have the ability to restore account/project data to the same system, to alternate AWS sites, and to a Cold standby hosted at Appdome Labs. In addition, Appdome takes backups of all data frequently and at regular intervals. We store backups at alternate sites, which permits ongoing use of the Appdome platform and data continuity in case of a disaster recovery scenario.\n\nAppdome uses AWS monitoring\u00a0and alerts, such as [Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) (SNS), to ensure proper operation and uptime of the Appdome system. We also use AWS\u00a0[CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for system-wide visibility, resource utilization and application performance monitoring. In addition, we leverage cutting edge technologies like Docker containerization inside AWS. This enables Appdome\u2019s Cloud Infrastructure to maintain operational health and recover from any degradation automatically, without human intervention.\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nContact Appdome at support@appdome.com for more information.

These files are essential for defining configuration details and settings that dictate how the SDK behaves when integrated with iOS applications. Like the more commonly known Info.plist files used in iOS apps, SDK Info.plist files are formatted in XML and serve as a collection of key-value pairs.\n\n**Key Aspects of SDK Info.plist Files:**\n\n* **Configuration Settings:** They store important parameters that can influence the SDK\u2019s functions, such as version information, SDK-specific permissions, and other operational parameters.\n* **Structured Data:** SDK Info.plist files organize data in a structured format, making it easy for both the iOS system and the applications that utilize the SDK to parse and manage.\n* **Integration Specifics:** These files can include keys that are specific to the SDK\u2019s integration with the app, such as hooks into app lifecycle events or environment-specific variables.\n\nThese plist files are integral to ensuring that the SDK integrates smoothly into an app\u2019s ecosystem, providing necessary information for both the app and the SDK to operate correctly within the iOS environment.\n\n## Why Protecting SDK Info.plist files is Essential?\n\nEncrypting SDK Info.plist files safeguard sensitive data from potential security threats. These files can contain API keys, backend service configurations, and other sensitive information that, if exposed, could lead to significant security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, unauthorized modifications to these files could compromise SDK functionality and app integrity. Common risks include:\n\n* **Unauthorized Feature Manipulation**: Modifying SDK features or behavior.\n* **Data Leakage**: Exposing sensitive information embedded within the SDK.\n* **Access Violations**: Unauthorized changes to permissions and settings.\n\n## Appdome\u2019s Protect Plist Feature for SDKs\n\nAppdome\u2019s Protect Plist feature explicitly addresses the security needs of SDK Info.plist files by encrypting them to prevent unauthorized access and modifications. This feature is designed to encrypt all plist files related to the SDK, excluding those necessary for app operation, such as app signing (e.g., entitlements and provisioning profiles).\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Protect Info.plist with Appdome SDKProtect\u2122\n\nBefore starting the process of securing your SDK with Appdome, ensure you have the following:\n\n* + Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n  + A license for\u00a0**SDKProtect\u2122**\n  + A valid **iOS .xcframework.zip file**\n\n### Protect Info.plist on iOS apps using Appdome:\n\nOn Appdome, follow these three simple steps to create self-defending iOS SDKs that Encrypt Info.plist.\n\n1. **[Upload](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1726988870936.1726992214475.204&__hssc=267077713.6.1726992214475&__hsfp=514922330) a Mobile SDK to Appdome.**\n   * **Upload Method:** Appdome Console or DEV-API\n   * **iOS Formats:** .xcframework.zip\n   * **Protect Info.plist Compatible With** Obj-C and Swift\n2. **Build the feature: Protect Info.plist.**\n\n#### Build Protect Info.plist using Appdome\u2019s DEV-API:\n\n1. * 1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the Encrypt Info.plist feature as shown below:  \n        ![New Fusion Set- Protect Info Plist](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-22-at-16.22.52.png)  \n        Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Encrypt Info.plist feature  \n        **Note:** Naming the Fusion Set to correspond to the protection(s) selected is for illustration purposes only (not required).\n     2. To add the Encrypt Info.plist feature to this Fusion Set, follow the steps in the section \u201cBuilding the Encrypt Info.plist feature via Appdome Console\u201d of this article.\n     3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c\u2026\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set. Copy the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):  \n        ![Copy Fs Id](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copy_fs_id-1.png)  \n        Figure 2: Fusion Set Detail Summary  \n        **Note:** Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n     4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, App Center, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI, or other systems:\n        + Build an API for the app \u2013 for instructions, see the tasks under\u00a0[Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1726988870936.1726992214475.204&__hssc=267077713.6.1726992214475&__hsfp=514922330)\n        + Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s\u00a0[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python)\n\n### Build the Encrypt Info.plist protection using Appdome Console:\n\n1. **Where:** Inside the Appdome Console, go to\u00a0**Build SDKProtect\u2122**\u00a0Tab >\u00a0**SDK Threat-Shielding**\u00a0section.\n2. **How:**\u00a0Toggle (turn ON) **Protect Info.plist**, as shown below:  \n   ![Toggle Protect Info](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Toggle-Protect-Info.png)  \n   Figure 3: Encrypt Info.plist option\n3. When you select the Encrypt Info.plist you\u2019ll notice that the Fusion Set you created now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Encrypt Info.plist  \n   Figure 4: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Encrypt Info.plist protection\n4. Click\u00a0**Build My App**\u00a0at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in\u00a0[Figure 3](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/protect-info-plist-files-in-ios-sdks/#figure_3)).\n\n**Congratulations!** The Encrypt Info.plist protection is now added to the mobile SDK\n\n![Iosxcframework Certificate Protect Info](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IosXcframework-Certificate-Protect-Info.png)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [Prevent Logging Attacks in iOS Apps to Prevent Data Leakage](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/prevent-logging-attacks/prevent-logging-in-ios/)\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Feature Strip Export Names in iOS SDKs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-sdk-security/sdk-security-integration/use-appdomes-feature-strip-export-names-in-ios-sdks/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1726988870936.1726992214475.204&__hssc=267077713.7.1726992214475&__hsfp=514922330)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1726988870936.1726992214475.204&__hssc=267077713.7.1726992214475&__hsfp=514922330)!

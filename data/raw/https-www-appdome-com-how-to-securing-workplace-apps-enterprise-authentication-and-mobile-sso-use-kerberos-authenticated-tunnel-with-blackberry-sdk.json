Additionally, BlackBerry offers an Authenticated Tunnel. Using the default tunneling solution from BlackBerry, users authenticate to BlackBerry and then to sign into the underlying mobile app. Using Authenticated Tunneling, BlackBerry users authenticate once to the BlackBerry environment only. Using an Authenticated Tunnel, the underlying mobile app trusts the BlackBerry authentication to access the corporate network.\n\nWhen using Appdome to add BlackBerry Dynamics Authenticated Tunnel to mobile apps, users authenticate to BlackBerry and then to sign into the underlying mobile app. Using Appdome\u2019s Authenticated Tunneling, BlackBerry users authenticate once to the BlackBerry environment only. Using an Authenticated Tunnel, the underlying mobile app trusts the BlackBerry authentication to access the corporate network.\n\nThis knowledge base article provides step-by-step instruction to use Kerberos Authenticated Tunnel with BlackBerry SDK to any Android and iOS app.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Use Kerberos Authenticated Tunnel with BlackBerry SDK\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features, like the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on Kerberos, OAuth, OpenID Connect or any other authentication standard inside the app. Users merely upload a mobile app binary, select the relevant Blackberry implementation option, and click \u201cBuild My App.\u201d The Appdome technology automatically adds Blackberry Dynamics SDK and relevant standards, frameworks and more to the app, with no manual development work at all. The integrated mobile apps will then use BlackBerry\u2019s Authenticated Tunnel to securely tunnel app data as if BlackBerry Authenticated tunneling schemes were natively coded to the app.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome for BlackBerry Authenticated EMM Tunnel\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of BlackBerry Authenticated Tunnel on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher.\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [BlackBerry Dynamics](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/make-android-ios-apps-work-blackberry-dynamics/) UEM server\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## The Easy Steps to Use Kerberos Authenticated Tunnel with BlackBerry SDK\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add Appdome Authenticated Tunnel to Any Mobile App:\n\n1. Upload a Mobile App to Your Account.  \n   Follow these steps to [add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \n   If you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n2. Go to **Build** > **Management**.\n3. Enable (toggle On) EMM Services.\n4. Select *BlackBerry Dynamic SDK* from the drop-down list.\n5. When prompted, confirm the replacement of Appdome Mobile Security Suite with your current choice.\n6. Change the App Bundle ID (optional).\n7. Change the App Version (optional).\n8. You can use the match BB Entitlement Version and BB Entitlement ID with the application\u2019s bundle identifier and bundle version. This will, in fact, change the application to be a different application. Some applications are not suitable for this change. For most apps this is required for touch ID authentication within the BB Dynamics SDK.  \n   ![Presentation5 4](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation5-4-1-650x238.png)\n9. Next, click to open **[Appdome Mobility Suite](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/guarantee-android-ios-compatibility-uem-mam/)**\u00a0and select **EMM Tunnel** as your tunneling scheme.\n   * Enable (toggle On)\u00a0**EMM Authenticated Tunnel only**if you\u2019ve set up your app to use\u00a0**Kerberos**\n   * Enable (toggle On) **Adaptive App Routing**. *Note: the default is to route all app traffic to the UEM.*\n     + If you only want Specific URL\u2019s to be Tunneled to the UEM, Enable (toggle On) **Inclusive Routing** and **Specify a list of protected URLs**.  \n       [Click here for more information about Adaptive App Routing.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/get-mobile-apps-work-eum-mdm-vpn-tunnel/)\n10.

Click\u00a0**Build My App**\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to add BlackBerry\u2019s Authenticated Tunneling to the mobile app in seconds. For example, the technology of Authenticating Tunnel Connections, work that ordinarily, a developer would need to do.\n\n**Congratulations!**\u00a0When Appdome has completed your implementation (usually about 30 seconds), you\u2019ll see the notice below. You now have a mobile app, fully integrated with Appdome\u2019s EMM Authenticated Tunnel.\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\n## After Adding EMM Authenticated Tunnel to a Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAfter you have added Appdome Authenticated Tunnel to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built App\n\nAppdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps ).\n\n### Sign the BlackBerry Dynamics enabled Appdome-Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-Built app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/) and [Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the Appdome-Built App to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Built apps, please read [this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome for BlackBerry Dynamics in your app!\n\n### **How Do I Learn More?**\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [**support.appdome.com**](http://support.appdome.com/ \"http://support.appdome.com/\") or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

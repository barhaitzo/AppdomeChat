There are no\u00a0additional development requirements to Fuse a mobile app that will not accept bundle ID changes with additional features and integrations.\u00a0 The Appdome technology adds relevant standards, frameworks and more to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\n## Building Mobile Apps that Don\u2019t Accept Bundle ID Changes with Additional Features Fast\n\n### Information on Mobile Apps\u2019 Frameworks and How They Can Use Bundle IDs\n\n* Some app frameworks enforce app licensing by specific app bundle IDs.\n* A bundle ID is a unique identifier for an app usually written in reverse DNS notation like com.appdome.example\n* Appdome provides the capability to modify an app bundle ID.\n* However, some apps utilize frameworks that do not permit their bundle ID to be changed.\n  + Appdome will detect these frameworks and prevent the bundle ID from being changed.\n  + One of these frameworks is PSPDFKit.\n    - For more information on this framework, [you can visit this resource](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/faq/strategies-for-multiple-bundle-ids/).\u00a0\u00a0We will continue adding more frameworks to Appdome.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome for Bundle ID Changes\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation to modify apps that don\u2019t allow bundle ID changes, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n### How to Build Apps with Frameworks Not Allowing Bundle ID Changes Without Errors\n\n* **Upload a Mobile App to Your Account**\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n* **From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, add Features and Services to your App**\n\nSelect the **Build\u00a0Tab**.\u00a0Beneath it, you will find several service options. Select the ones you\u2019d like applied to your app then **Build My App**!\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\n**Congratulations!**You now have a mobile app fully integrated with the features you selected even when it didn\u2019t accept bundle ID changes.\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built App\n\nAppdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform.\u00a0 Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this\u00a0[knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps ).\n\n### Sign the Appdome Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome Built app, it must be signed.\u00a0\u00a0[Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\u00a0and\u00a0[Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/)\u00a0are easy using Appdome.\u00a0 Alternatively, you can use\u00a0[Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the\u00a0Appdome-Built App\u00a0to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Built apps, please read\u00a0[this knowledge base](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nFor more information on this topic, visit \u00a0Appdome for [Enterprise Mobility](/enterprise-mobile-apps/uem-mam-sdks/enterprise-mobility/) on our website.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

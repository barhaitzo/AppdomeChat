No code, no SDK and no development are required. App SECURE automatically shields and hardens native and non-native code, app logic and workflows against inspection, debugging, tampering, reverse engineering as well prevents anyone from running your app on emulators or simulators.\n\n## Appdome App Secure Protects the App\n\nApp SECURE protects against any malicious use of a mobile app and allows developers to quickly achieve three top mobile app security objectives for native and non-native mobile apps alike: (1) block hackers from using your app to create attacks, cheats and malicious programs, (2) prevent inspection and theft of your code and intellectual property, and (3) stop modifications to the app, including screens, workflows, APIs, frameworks and more.\n\nAppdome App SECURE achieves these objectives using two key Appdome features:\n\n[ONEShield\u2122 App Hardening](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) \u2013 Comprehensive, self-defending, no-code mobile app shielding and hardening solution that prevents dynamic analysis, tampering, modifying, debugging or interfering with the app\u2019s workflows as well as blocks emulators and simulators. ONEShield includes these defenses throughout the app, including hundreds of overlapping Checksum validations to ensure tamper resistance of the app.\n\n[TOTALCode\u2122 Obfuscation](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/no-code-mobile-app-obfuscation-resources/) \u2013 Complete no-code, advanced code obfuscating solution that prevents static analysis, obfuscates the entire binary, protects native code as well as non-native code/libraries, SDKs and frameworks in the app. Specific add-ons include relocating control flows, scrambling your app\u2019s logic, and stripping debug information \u2013 all without symbolization or decorating your code or limiting how your app functions.\n\n## Additional Services\n\nAdditional features are available with the [App PROTECT](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/appdome-app-protect-package/) and [App DEFEND](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/appdome-app-defend-package/) Packages.\n\n24x7x365 customer support as well as advanced services such as Appdome-GO, Appdome-DEV, Appdome-DEV Support, Appdome-DEV Tools and Appdome-DEV API are available at an extra charge.\n\n## Learn More\n\nTo learn more, please visit the [Appdome pricing page](/appdome-pricing/) or [contact sales](https://www.appdome.com/contact-appdome/mobile-app-security/).\n\nWant a Demo?\n\nAppdome Basics\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Alan_Bavosa_B.jpg)\n\nAlanWe're here to help\n\n\n\n\nWe'll get back to you in 24 hours to schedule your demo.\n\n* [Home Page](https://www.appdome.com/)\n* [Dev+Sec Blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/)\n* [Request A Demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/appdome-home/)\n* [Platform](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-tool-cicd/)\n* [Pricing](https://www.appdome.com/appdome-pricing/)\n* [About](https://www.appdome.com/about/)\n* [Patents](https://www.appdome.com/legal/patents/)\n* [Knowledge Base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/)\n* [In The News](https://www.appdome.com/in-the-news/)\n* [Careers we\u2019re hiring!](https://www.appdome.com/about/work-at-appdome/)\n* [Terms Of Use](https://www.appdome.com/legal/terms-of-use/)\n* [Press Releases](https://www.appdome.com/press-releases/)\n* [Privacy Policy](https://www.appdome.com/legal/privacy-policy/)\n* [Contact Us](https://www.appdome.com/contact-us/)\n\n\n\n---\n\nREDWOOD CITY OFFICE\n\n* 3 Twin Dolphin Drive,   \n  Suite 375 Redwood City,   \n  CA 94065\n* Phone: [+1.650.567.6100](tel:+16505676100)   \n  Mobile: [+1.844.360.FUSE (3873)](tel:+1844360FUSE (3873))   \n  Email: [info@appdome.com](mailto:info@appdome.com)\n\nISRAEL OFFICE\n\n* 21 HaArba'a Street,\n* Phone: [+97235568332](tel:+97235568332)   \n  Email: [info@appdome.com](mailto:info@appdome.com)\n\nSearch for:\n\nFollow us\n\n\u00a92026 Appdome, Inc.

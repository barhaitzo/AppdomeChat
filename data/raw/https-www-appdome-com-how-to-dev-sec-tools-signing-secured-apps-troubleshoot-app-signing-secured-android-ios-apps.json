Appdome provides tools to validate app signing when users sign mobile apps locally or privately on their own systems. This Knowledge Base article offers step-by-step instructions for using Appdome to troubleshoot app signing in secured Android and iOS mobile apps.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## Using Appdome to Troubleshoot App Signing in Secured Android & iOS Apps\n\nAppdome is a mobile security platform that allows users to add a wide variety of features, SDKs, and APIs to Android and iOS apps. Using a simple \u2018click to add\u2019 user interface, Appdome allows anyone to easily add additional functionality to any mobile app \u2013 instantly, with no code or coding required.\n\nIn order to deploy a secured app, it must be signed. Users have the flexibility of signing fused applications inside or outside of Appdome. We highly recommend using the built-in app signing functionality in Appdome. Appdome uses multiple input validation mechanisms to ensure the proper signing of each mobile app. Deploying an Appdome-Fused app is only possible if it has been properly signed.\n\nIf you choose to sign an Appdome-Fused app outside of Appdome, Appdome offers an App Validation service to troubleshoot app signing in secured Android & iOS apps. The service also verifies that the app wasn\u2019t tampered with in any way that may prevent it from running on any mobile device.\n\n## Prerequisites for using Appdome\u2019s App Validation\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s app validation, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or higher.\n* Signed mobile app (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n\n## Easy Steps to Troubleshoot App Signing in Secured Android & iOS Apps\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to troubleshoot app signing in secured Android & iOS apps:\n\n1. **Login** to your Appdome account\n2. **Click** **on your username** in the top-right corner of the screen\n3. Select App Validation.\n\n![Menu](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/menu-2-304x731.png)\n\n4. Upload your signed mobile app by dragging the app file to the dropbox or by browsing your device for the app file.  \n**Note!** You cannot validate an app unless you are authorized to change its functionality\n\n![Adding Your App 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/adding-your-app-2.png)\n\n5. Once your app has fully loaded, Appdome\u2019s app validation process will start automatically.\n\n![Validation In Progres 3](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/validation-in-progres-3-e1704959122567.png)\n\nWhen the app validation process is complete, Appdome will present the results of the validated app signing at the bottom of the screen.\n\n### Here Are a Few Examples of App Validation Results:\n\n* Correctly signed app:\n\n![Compleate](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compleate.png)\n\n* Falsely signed iOS app (private signing):\n\n![Private Sigining Ios [ Failed ]](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/private-sigining-ios-failed-.png)\n\n* Android app signed with incorrect keystore\u00a0(private signing):\n\n![Private Sign [failed] Android ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/private-sign-failed-android_.png)\n\n## How Do I Correctly Sign My App?\n\n[Signing an iOS app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode ) and[Signing an Android app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) is easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), which requires downloading your unsigned app and signing it locally using your own signing methods.\n\nMake sure to sign correctly, as an incorrect signature can trigger Appdome\u2019s [Anti-Tampering](/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/prevent-mods-code-changes-mobile-apps/) protection.\n\n## How to Validate the Signing SHA-1 or SHA-256 of a Google Play App\n\nIn some cases, Google Play resigns the application. In these cases, the SHA1 or the SHA-256 can be extracted via the [Google Play Console](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/extracting-a-sha-1-fingerprint-from-the-google-play-app-signing-certificate/). Or Via [extracting the downloaded](https://www.wikihow.tech/Extract-APK-File-of-Any-App-on-Your-Android-Phone) apk from an Android phone and uploading it to the verification tool as depicted above.\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nCheck out\u00a0[Appdome\u2019s platform](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-appdome-no-code-platform-works/) or\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build-to-Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [Appdome Diagnostic Logs for Troubleshooting Secured iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/appdome-diagnostic-logs-for-troubleshooting-secured-ios-apps/)\n* [How to Resolve Common Google Play Errors for Secured Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/resolve-common-google-play-errors-for-secured-apps/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

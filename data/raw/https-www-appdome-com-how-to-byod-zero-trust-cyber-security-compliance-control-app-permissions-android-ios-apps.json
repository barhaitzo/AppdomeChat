These controls enable developers to protect end-user privacy and guard against unauthorized access or permission abuses by rogue apps.\n\n## How to Control App Permissions in Android and iOS app\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding. When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App\u201d, Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nUsing Appdome, mobile apps will disable the requested features as if Mobile Permission Control was natively coded to the app. Appdome is compatible with mobile apps built in any development environment including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps and non-native apps built-in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic, and more. This streamlines implementations, cuts development work, and ensures a guaranteed and consistent way to control app permissions for any iOS or Android app no matter how the original app was built.\n\n### Available controls\n\n* **Prohibit Local Contacts** \u2013 Prevents users from importing local contacts to the app\n* **Prohibit Local Calendar**\u00a0\u2013 Prevents importing the local calendar to the app\n* **In-App Calls Only** \u2013 Ensures all calls are made using the apps native dialer when applicable. This prevents the app from displaying alternate phone apps when a phone number is clicked within the app.\n* **In-App Messages Only** \u2013 This option ensures all messages are made using the app\u2019s native messaging service, when applicable. This prevents the app from displaying alternate messaging apps when contact is clicked within the app.\n* **Prohibit Camera** \u2013 Prevents access to the camera by the app\n  + **Prohibit Camera via Image Requests **(Android only) \u2013 Disables the app from accessing images from external sources including the camera app and gallery****\n* **Prohibit Microphone** \u2013\u00a0Prevents access to the microphone by the app\n* **Prohibit Location** \u2013\u00a0Prevents access to the device\u2019s location (GPS, GLONASS, etc\u2026) by the app\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome to control app permissions\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of Mobile app Permission Control on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0IDEAL or higher\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Control App Permissions in Android and iOS Apps\n\nMobile Permission Control is a part of Appdome Mobility Suite. Follow these step-by-step instructions to add Mobile Permission Control to Any Mobile App:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n### From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add Mobile Permission Control\n\nSelect the\u00a0**Build Tab**. Beneath the Build Tab, you will find several service options. Select **Management**, choose an EMM/MAM services to Build and under Appdome Mobility Suite, select the permissions you\u2019d like to limit.\n\n1. Click on the accordion to access **Mobile Permission Control**\n2. Select the permissions you\u2019d like to limit\n3. Click\u00a0**Build My App**\n\n   ![Mobile Permission Control](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mobile-permission-control-1.png)\n\n   The technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a micro-service architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integrations, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to add Mobile Permission Control to the mobile app in seconds. For example, the technology of Webview authentication, work that ordinarily a developer would need to do.\n\n   **Congratulations!**\u00a0You now have a mobile app fully integrated with Mobile Permission Control.![Succes](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/succes.png)\n\n   ## What\u2019s next after you control app permissions?\n\n   After you have added Mobile Permission Control to any mobile app on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n   ### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built App\n\n   Appdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform.

Some browsers could be malicious, or not secure. As such, EMMs usually provide their own secure browser, and enforce using this browser according to its preconfigured DLP policies.\n\nConnect Secure Browser is Appdome\u2019s solution for ensuring EMM DLP policies are enforced when opening browser links on an Appdome fused app. Appdome ensures that\u00a0for secure policy configurations, links opened through the fused app are opened exclusively by the EMM\u2019s secure browser app. Or are blocked if no such browser exists.\n\nThis knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for adding Appdome\u2019s Connect Secure Browser to any iOS and Android mobile app.\n\n## How to Use Secure UEM MAM Browser in Android & iOS Apps\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nLikewise, there are no required infrastructure changes or configuration changes required inside the app. The Appdome technology adds any EMM SDK and relevant standards, frameworks, configurations and more to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nUsing Appdome, mobile apps will adhere to your EMM security and connectivity policy as if the EMM SDK was natively coded to the app. Appdome for Enterprise Mobility Management is compatible with mobile apps built in any development environment including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps and non-native apps built in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic and more. This streamlines implementations, cuts development work, and ensures a guaranteed and consistent integration of any EMM SDK to any mobile app.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome\u2019s Connect Secure Browser\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code Connect Secure Browser you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\n* One of the supported EMM accounts, [Intune](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/make-mobile-apps-work-microsoft-intune-app-sdk/), [VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-vmware-workspace-one/make-android-ios-apps-work-workspace-one/) or [BlackBerry Good](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/make-android-ios-apps-work-blackberry-dynamics/)\n* DLP policy that supports secure browser Lock-down. For example:\n  + Microsoft Intune DLP configuration instructions can be found [here](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/intune-boostemm-policy/)\n  + BlackBerry Dynamics DLP configuration instructions can be found [here](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/prevent-blackberry-dynamics-data-leakage-mobile-apps/)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## 4 Easy Steps to Use Secure UEM MAM Browser in Android & iOS Apps\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add Connect Secure Browser\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to [add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n#### **From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add Appdome BoostEMM**\u2122\n\nSelect the **Build\u00a0Tab**. Select **Management**.\n\n1. Click the **EMM Services** toggle to the right to enable integration with an Enterprise Mobility Management service.\n2. Choose your desired EMM.\n3. On the **BoostEMM\u2122****by Appdome** section, toggle the **Connect Secure Browser**\u00a0button.  \n   ***Note**: Microsoft Intune Android users Already have all of Appdome BoostEMM**\u2122** features enabled, so this step can be skipped.*\n4. Click Build My App.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation12.png)\n\nThe monitoring of links from all the app\u2019s code including its libraries would ordinarily require a developer to implement.\n\nThe technology behind Build My App has two major elements \u2013 (1) a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of code sets needed for mobile integration, and (2) an adaptive code generation engine that can recognize the development environment, frameworks and methods in each app and match the app to the relevant code-sets needed to add an EMM SDK and secure browser redirection to the mobile app in seconds.\n\n**Congratulations!** You now have a mobile app fully integrated with Connect Secure Browser.  \n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Success.png)\n\n## After adding Connect Secure Browser to a Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAfter you have added Appdome Connect Secure Browser to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built App\n\nAppdome is a full featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps ).\n\n### Sign the Connect Secure Browser enabled Appdome-Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-Built app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/) and [Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the\u00a0Appdome-Built App\u00a0to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Built apps, please read [this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Connect Secure Browser in your app!\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nCheck out Appdome for EMM [blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/add-emm-sdk-secure-browser-secure-mail/)\u00a0or [request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/) at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\nTo zoom out on this topic, visit\u00a0 [BoostEMM by Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/boostemm-by-appdome/).\n\n---\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com)!

Built on Appdome\u2019s autonomous SecOps intelligence, MRI provides a dynamic, numerical representation of risk, continuously updated using trillions of monthly threat events and your app\u2019s real-world attack surface. It highlights where threats, vulnerabilities, or defense gaps are increasing exposure.\n\n[![Mri Full Panel](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MRI_Full_Panel.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MRI_Full_Panel.png)\n\n**MRI helps mobile teams:**\n\n* Measure the app\u2019s risk level using a clear, data-backed score.\n* Compare performance and exposure against global and industry benchmarks.\n* Analyze indicators such as infection rate, frequency, and attack velocity to identify emerging threats.\n* Use real-time insights and trend analysis to prioritize defenses and strengthen security posture.\n* This provides a fast, objective way to understand risk, reduce investigation time, and guide data-driven security decisions across the mobile business.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome\u2019s Mobile Risk Index\u2122:\n\n* Before using Mobile Risk Index\u2122, ensure you meet the following requirements:\n* Appdome account ([create a free Appdome account here](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* **A license for Agentic AI**\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see [Signing Secure Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [Signing Secure iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n### How to Use Mobile Risk Index\u2122\n\n1. Log in to your Appdome account.\n\n2. Click on the arrow icon under \u201cWhat\u2019s in My Mobile Risk Index?\u201d on the top of the page.  \n[![Mri Arrow](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MRI_Arrow.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MRI_Arrow.png)  \nThe Risk Index ranges from 250-1000:  \n**250-500 (Normal):** No significant risks detected. No immediate action is required.  \n**501-750 (Review):** Moderate risks detected. Review and analyze your app\u2019s security.  \n**751-1000 (Act):** High risks detected. Immediate action is needed to mitigate threats.\n\n3. Explore The MRI Info Cards and Risk Drivers;\n\n* **Mobile Risk Index\u2122** shows the overall MRI score across all impacted apps with over 1,000 installs, with a side panel highlighting the three latest builds by event volume and their individual scores.  \n  [![Mri Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MRI_card.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MRI_card.png)\n* **Apps Card** shows how many apps are included in the MRI calculation, The MRI is calculated only for apps with upwards of 1000 installs.  \n  [![Apps Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Apps-Card.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Apps-Card.png)\n* **Events** shows the total number of threat events used to compute the MRI across all included apps.  \n  [![Events Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Events-Card.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Events-Card.png)\n* **Infection Rate** is the proportion of app installs impacted by threats, showing how broadly a threat has spread across the user base; it\u2019s calculated by dividing the number of infected installs by the total installs.  \n  **Example**: If 1,000 devices have installed your app and 100 are infected, the infection rate is 10%.  \n  [![Infection Rate Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Infection-Rate-Card.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Infection-Rate-Card.png)\n* **Velocity** measures how quickly the infection rate is changing over time, helping teams spot accelerating threats early; it\u2019s calculated by comparing infection rate values across defined time intervals.  \n  **Example**: If the infection rate increases from 5% to 10% over a month, velocity indicates an accelerating trend.  \n  [![Velocity Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Velocity-Card.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Velocity-Card.png)\n* **Frequency** represents the number of attack events per user session, indicating how actively threats target users during normal app usage; it\u2019s calculated by dividing total attack events by the number of sessions.  \n  **Example**: If there are 50 attack events across 25 sessions, the frequency is 2 attacks per session.  \n  [![Frequency Card](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Frequency-Card.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Frequency-Card.png)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to use Appdome\u2019s AI Agent Team](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/agentic-ai/use-appdomes-ai-agent-team/)\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Support Agent](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/agentic-ai/use-appdomes-support-agent/)\n* [How To use No-Code Security for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/using-no-code-security-for-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How To Get Started with Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/getting-started-with-appdome/)\n* [How To Release Secured Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/releasing-secured-android-ios-apps/)\n* [Appdome Support Levels Overview](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/appdome-support-levels-overview/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

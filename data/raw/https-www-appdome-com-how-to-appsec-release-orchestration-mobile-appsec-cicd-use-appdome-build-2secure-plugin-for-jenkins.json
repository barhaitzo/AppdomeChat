This can be achieved without the need for additional code or SDKs.\n\nThe purpose of Appdome\u2019s Build-2Secure plugin for Jenkins is to streamline and accelerate cyber and anti-fraud delivery in CI/CD pipelines. To do this, the Build-2Secure plugin for Jenkins automates three important steps in delivering more secure mobile applications to your users quickly:\n\n*(1)* Building app-level protections into mobile apps.\n\n*(2)* Code-signing the protected mobile app.\n\n*(3)* Certifying the security of each protected mobile app.\n\nThe Appdome Build-2Secure plugin for Jenkins can deliver\u00a0**Certified Secure\u2122**\u00a0mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile anti-bot, and other cyber defense updates to mobile apps on the\u00a0[**Appdome Cyber Defense Automation Platform**](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-cicd-system/). It can function as a stand-alone DevSecOps integration or in tandem with other DevSecOps integrations in your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nFor more general information on this plugin, see [Managing Plugins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/) on the Jenkins website.\n\nBelow are the step-by-step instructions on how to use the **Appdome Build-2Secure** plugin for Jenkins.\n\n## Prerequisites for Appdome\u2019s Jenkins plugin\n\nBefore you use Appdome\u2019s plugin for Jenkins, there are a few things you need to have:\n\n* An\u00a0[Appdome SRM account](https://www.appdome.com/devsecops-release-management/)\n* [Appdome API token](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-and-resetting-your-api-token)\n* [Fusion-Set ID](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-a-fusion-sets-id)\n* [Jenkins CI/CD server](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/)\n* [CURL](https://curl.se/) installed on your Node.\n* [Environment Injector](https://plugins.jenkins.io/envinject/) plugin (Optional)\n\n## Step 1: Installing the Build-2Secure plugin in Jenkins\n\n1.

Proceed to set the Appdome build-2Secure plugin configuration, as described in the next step.\n\n## Step 2: Configuring Build-2Secure Plugin on Appdome\n\nTo use the Appdome build-2Secure plugin, add one of the next pipeline templates:\n\n**Inputs explanation:**\n\nReplace all placeholders, which are located within brackets (for example, \u2018**<YOUR\\_TOKEN>**\u2018) with the right value in accordance with the relevant template:\n\n* To use the **token** field, replace \u2018*<YOUR\\_TOKEN>*\u2018 with your Appdome Build2Secure API token. You can obtain this token by following the instructions provided in the [API guide](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-and-resetting-your-api-token).\n* To use the **teamId**\u00a0field (optional), replace \u2018*<YOUR\\_TEAMID\\_OR\\_LEAVE\\_EMPTY\\_FOR\\_PERSONAL>*\u2018 with your team ID or leave it empty for personal workspace. You can\u00a0obtain this key by following the instructions\u00a0provided in the [API guide.](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-a-teams-id)\n* To use the **fusionSetId**field, replace \u2018*<YOUR\\_FUSIONSET\\_ID>*\u2018 with the appropriate [fusion-set-id](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-a-fusion-sets-id) for your iOS or Android application. For details, see the section [Getting a Fusion Set\u2019s ID](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/getting-started#getting-a-fusion-sets-id) in the API guide. If you want to learn more about file paths, read the description below; otherwise, proceed to the next step.\n* To use the **Datadog**field, replace \u2018*<*YOUR\\_DATADOG\\_ID*>*\u2018 with your Datadog ID. This integration with Datadog automates the de-obfuscation process, allowing Appdome to upload de-obfuscated mapping files directly to your Datadog account.\n* Additionally, include the following in each example of the Android templates:\n\n  ```\n  datadog: <YOUR_DATADOG_KEY>\n  ```\n* To use the **Crashlytics** field, replace `<YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID>` with your Firebase App ID. This integration with Firebase Crashlytics automates the deobfuscation process, allowing Appdome to upload de-obfuscated mapping files directly to your Crashlytics account.  \n  Additionally, include the following in each example of the Android templates:\n\n  ```\n  crashlytics: <YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID\n  ```\n\n**Dynamic Certificate**\n\nCertificate pinning is a security technique that is used to ensure that only a specific, trusted server certificate is accepted when establishing HTTPS connections. This prevents attackers from using forged certificates to intercept data and perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nThe dynamic certificate input is a .zip archive file that contains:\n\n* The certificate files (e.g., cer, .crt, .zip, .pem, .der)\n* A certs.json file that maps hostnames to certificate filenames, using the format: **{ \u201c<host>\u201d: \u201c<cert\\_file\\_name>\u201d }**\n\nTo enable dynamic certificate pinning, follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the zip file according to the guidelines above.\n2. Include the zip file in your pipeline configuration by adding the dynamicCertificate parameter at the same level as the teamId and token. See the example below.\n3. Ensure the path is absolute and accessible from the Jenkins environment.\n\n```\nappdomeBuild2Secure(\r\nteamId: StringWarp(\"YOUR_TEAM_ID\"),\r\ntoken: StringWarp(\"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\"),\r\ndynamicCertificate: StringWarp(\"PATH_TO_YOUR_DYNAMIC_CERTIFICATE_ZIP\")\r\n// other parameters... )\n```\n\n**File Paths**When working with files, you can set the files in any of the following methods:\n\n* Provide the full path to the file, which should be located on the node machine.\n* Use environment variables with the **Environment Injector** plugin or Configure the node machine settings in Jenkins.\n* Set a remote URL link to a file either on the configuration page or as an environment variable.\n\nFor instructions on how to set environment variables, see\u00a0**Appendix A: How to Set Environment Variables**.\n\nTo use the\u00a0**appPath** field\n\n* Replace \u2018*<FULL\\_PATH\\_OR\\_URL\\_TO\\_APP\\_FILE>*\u2018 with the full path on the node machine.\n* Specify a full path to the file as an environment variable named **APP\\_PATH**. If using the environment variable, leave **appPath**\u00a0empty.\n* Replace \u2018*<FULL\\_PATH\\_OR\\_URL\\_TO\\_APP\\_FILE>\u2019* with a remote URL link to a file either on the pipeline page or as an environment variable named **APP\\_PATH**.\u00a0 If using the environment variable, leave **appPath**\u00a0empty.  \n  **Note:** The URL link must not contain any commas.\n\nTo use the **provisioningProfiles**field under iOS signing.

To utilize it, specify the supported Testing Service and use this syntax:\n\n**Note:** It is not designed for individual device testing.\n\n```\nbuildToTest: [selectedVendor: '<VENDOR_NAME>' ]\n```\n\nInsert the relevant <*VENDOR\\_NAME*> from the list:\n\nSAUCELABS\n\nBITBAR\n\nLAMBDATEST\n\nBROWSERSTACK\n\n**Note:** Only Saucelabs is supported for iOS.\n\n**Second Output** (.aab apps only): To sign the second output, specify a set path where the subsequent .apk file will be downloaded. Make sure to specify a full path for the application. To utilize it, enter the following syntax:\n\n```\nsecondOutput: StringWarp('<PATH_TO_SECOND_OUTPUT>.apk')\n```\n\nThe **<***PATH\\_TO\\_SECOND\\_OUTPUT***>** represents the full path for the application.  \nFor example: **<***your\\_path/second\\_output***>.apk**\n\n**Note:** This option is relevant only for apps signed either with Appdome Auto Sign or Private Sign. It is not applicable to Auto-Dev Private Signed apps.\n\n**Show workflow output logs:** see any logs that are specifically generated by the Appdome integration at the \u201c**Console Output**\u201d as explained in \u201c**Step 6: Confirming Cyber Build and Sign on Appdome**\u201d.\n\nTo enable **workflow output logs**, go to the pipeline inside the AppdomeBuilder section and choose:\n\n```\nworkflowOutputLogs: true\n```\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to use \u2018workflowOutputLogs\u2019, you can either omit this parameter or set its value to \u2018false\u2019.\n\n```\nworkflowOutputLogs: false\n```\n\nIn addition, those logs will always be saved into a file named \u201cworkflow\\_output\\_logs.log\u201d at your output location as you defined it in the \u201c**Output Location\u201d** field.\n\nAll parameters within the pipeline template must be situated within the AppdomeBuilder section.

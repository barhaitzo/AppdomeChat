Go to Local Traffic -> Profiles -> SSL -> Client  \n![Profiles Ssl Client](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/profiles-ssl-client.png)\n\n2. Select your profile  \n3. Under Client Certificate, select Require  \n4. Under Trusted Certificate Authorities, select the CA certificate of your choice.\n\n![Set Client Certificate As Required](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Set-Client-Certificate-as-required-650x249.png)\n\nThe following iRule code snippet provides a method for validating an SSL certificate\u2019s fingerprint during a client handshake on an F5 BIG-IP server. It extracts and checks the peer\u2019s certificate\u2019s SHA256 fingerprint against a predefined expected value. If the fingerprints match, the connection is allowed; if not, it is rejected, ensuring only authorized access.\n\n```\n # Initialization block executed when the rule is loaded.\r\nwhen RULE_INIT {\r\n    # The expected certificate fingerprint\r\n    set expected_fingerprint \"123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0\"\r\n    set expected_fingerprint_binary [binary format H* $expected_fingerprint]\r\n\r\n    set expected_fingerprint2 \"123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0\"\r\n    set expected_fingerprint_binary2 [binary format H* $expected_fingerprint2]\r\n}\r\nwhen CLIENTSSL_HANDSHAKE {\r\n    global logs_on log_level log_levels expected_fingerprint_binary expected_fingerprint_binary2\r\n    # Retrieve the peer certificate presented during the handshake\r\n    set peer_cert [SSL::cert 0]\r\n    # extract the public key from an mTLS p12 cert by using:\r\n    # > openssl pkcs12 -in client-cert.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out client-cert.pem\r\n    # Use the command > openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in client-cert.pem\r\n    # on the public key of the mTLS cert to extract the certificate fingerprint.\r\n    # Extract the fingerprint (SHA256 in this case) of the peer certificate\r\n    set sha256_hash [sha256 $peer_cert]\r\n    # use if you wish to reject based on the fingerprint instead of based on the rootCA signed the cert you can enable this piece of code\r\n    # you should also change the Client Certificate in the SSL client profile into a \"Request\" mode.\r\n    # if {[string length $peer_cert] == 0} {\r\n    #     log local0. \"no client cert, rejecting\"\r\n    #     reject\r\n    #     return\r\n    # }  \r\n\r\n    # Compare the certificate's fingerprint to the expected fingerprint\r\n    if { $sha256_hash eq $expected_fingerprint_binary || $sha256_hash eq $expected_fingerprint_binary2 } {\r\n        if { $logs_on == 1 && $log_levels($log_level) <= $log_levels(DEBUG) } {\r\n            log local0. \"Certificate fingerprint matches\"\r\n        }\r\n        # Allow connection\r\n    } else {\r\n        if { $logs_on == 1 && $log_levels($log_level) <= $log_levels(INFO) } {\r\n            log local0. \"Certificate fingerprint mismatch Dropping connection.\"\r\n        }\r\n        reject\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\n\nRun the following command to extract your SHA256 fingerprint.\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in your_certificate.pem\n```\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```\nSHA256 Fingerprint=\"123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0\"\n```\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to Enforce mTLS Pre-Authentication in MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/enforce-mtls-pre-authentication-in-mobilebot-defense/)\n* [Creating a Virtual Server on F5](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/creating-a-virtual-server-on-f5/)\n* [Configuring iRules for Custom Traffic Management on F5 (Session Headers)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appdome/knowledge-base/configuring-irules-for-custom-traffic-management-on-f5-session-headers)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1729407356686.1729409421879.260&__hssc=267077713.27.1729409421879&__hsfp=203575498)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)!

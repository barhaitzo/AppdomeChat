For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement. The iOS (.ipa) or Android (.apk or .aab) App can be built in any development environment such as xCode for iOS and Android Studio, or non-native environments like Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native. The Appdome technology adds features and relevant standards, frameworks and more to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\n## Appdome Compatibility Guidelines for Integrated Mobile Apps\n\n### Mobile OS (iOS and Android) Guidelines\n\nMobile Apps integrated on Appdome support the most current versions of mobile operating systems (iOS and Android) as well as prior versions based on the support policy available here.\n\nhttps://appdome.com/knowledgebase/appdome-support-eol-policies-mobile-os-sdks/\n\nIf you are running an OS version which are older than required, you should upgrade the OS on the device before Fusing your app.\n\n### Mobile App Size Guidelines\n\nPlease note that, in order to protect the service and the experience of our users, the Appdome platform limits the max size of each app to 300MB.\u00a0 This Mobile App file size be increased by contacting our support team at support@appdome.com or by using the chat icon on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Does Appdome work with my apps (i.e. apps that I developed)?\n\nYes. \u00a0Appdome supports the fusion of any app which meets our mobile requirements.

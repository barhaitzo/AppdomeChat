Appdome enables customers to effectively verify user domains for mobile security projects so that all their team members are members of the same domain. This Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions on how to enforce organization domain verification on your Appdome teams.\n\n## How to Verify User Domains for Mobile Security Projects\n\nAppdome allows organizations to create teams within the Appdome workflow and lock teams so that only members from the same email domain as the team leader can be invited. By limiting the team to a specific domain, you can avoid preventable mistakes (for example, adding a team member using their personal email) and complete mobile integrations efficiently. Appdome keeps both your user\u2019s and project data safe and protected and controls access to your team.\n\n### Prerequisites for Organization Domain Enforcement in Teams\n\nIn order to lock your team domain, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)Ideal [IDEAL](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/choosing-appdomes-ideal-account/) GO or higher.\n* [Appdome-DEV](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* [An Appdome Team](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/use-team-workflows-mobile-app-security-projects/) where you are enrolled as a \u2018Leader\u2019 (Learn more about [Teams Entitlements](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/set-user-entitlements-mobile-app-security-projects/))\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Verify User Domains for Mobile Security Projects\n\n1.

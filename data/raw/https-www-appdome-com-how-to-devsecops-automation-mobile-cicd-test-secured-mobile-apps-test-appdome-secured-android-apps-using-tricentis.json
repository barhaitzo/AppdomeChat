Appdome integrates seamlessly with leading mobile testing solutions, empowering customers to enhance mobile app security within their existing application lifecycle with the speed and agility of DevSecOps.\n\n**Using Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service (Recommended)**  \nCustomers with an Appdome SRM license can use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service to quickly and easily test their Appdome-secured mobile apps using\u00a0Tricentis Device Cloud\u00a0without the need for different Fusion Sets. With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida.\n\nFor more details, see [How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## General Information About Testing Appdome Build2Test-Secured Android Apps\n\nWhen testing Appdome Build2Test-secured Android apps with Tricentis Device Cloud, the following Appdome protection features may be triggered:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Detect Developer Options | Tricentis Device Cloud might enable developer options to facilitate testing, which is detected as a potential security risk. | The app will detect this but will not crash, allowing testing to continue. |\n| Block Android Debug Bridge (ADB) | Tricentis Device Cloud uses ADB for interactions during tests, which this feature blocks to prevent unauthorized control. | The app will detect ADB usage but will not crash, ensuring smooth testing. |\n| Prevent App Screen Sharing | Tricentis Device Cloud records the screen during tests, triggering the screen-sharing protection. | The app will recognize the screen recording but will continue running without crashing. |\n| Keylogging Prevention | Testing scripts that simulate inputs in a way that resembles keylogging might trigger this feature. | The app will detect potential keylogging behavior but will not crash. |\n\n## Upload the App to Tricentis Device Cloud for Testing\n\n1.

The dashboard\u2019s data refreshes every hour, allowing security teams to monitor evolving attacks and swiftly respond to emerging trends in real-time. To ensure that threats faced by a protected app are displayed on the dashboard, there\u2019s no need for prerequisites, API integrations by the Operations teams, or code changes by the mobile development teams.\n\n## Setting up Access to ThreatScope Dashboard\n\nAccess to a protected app\u2019s threat data on the ThreatScope Dashboard is gated only to viewer accounts that meet the following conditions:\n\n* The viewer account is licensed to access the ThreatScope Dashboard  \n  Submit a request to Appdome support to activate the license for the accounts that should have access to threat data.\n* Threat data originates from teams of which the viewer is a member.  \n  The team leader of each production team should configure the viewer account. For details, see the section **Configuring the Viewer Account**.\n* The viewer has the View ThreatScope entitlement in the team.  \n  For more details, see the section **Add View ThreatScope Entitlement** to Members Account below.\n\n### Configuring the Viewer Account\n\nTo configure the viewer account, the team leader needs to:\n\n1. Open the User Menu.\n2. Click on **Team Management**.  \n   ![User Menu Threatscope](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/user-menu-threatscope-307x731.png)\n3. Search for the relevant team.\n4. Review the team member list.  \n   ![View Team Members](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/View-Team-Members.png)  \n   If the requested viewer\u2019s account does not appear, invite the viewer by clicking the Invite New Member button.  \n   ![Invite New Member](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Invite-New-Member.png)\n5. Type the viewer account\u2019s name and hit enter. When done, click **Invite**.  \n   ![Invite New Members to Team](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2024-05-22-at-14.02.15.png)\n6. After the viewer accepts the invitation, proceed to the next step of adding the required entitlements to the team.\n\n### Add View ThreatScope Entitlement to Members Account\n\nIn order to add the **View ThreatScope** entitlement to a member\u2019s account of a production team, the team leader should follow these steps:\n\n1. Click on **Team Management** account in the user menu and click the button to add entitlements.  \n   A list of the entitlements available for the account will be displayed.\n2. Click the **View ThreatScope** entitlement.  \n   ![Viewthreatscopebutton](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ViewThreatScopeButton-1.png)\n\n## Reviewing the Dashboard Structure\n\nThe dashboard allows you to perform the following tasks:\n\n* Select the viewing scope\n* Select the date range\n* Review the geographical source of threats\n* View all attacks\n* Use the Performance Stream widget\n* Display top 10 defense breakdown\n* View Attacks Breakdown\n* Filter Missing Intelligence\n* Review performance streams\n\n### Selecting the Viewing Scope\n\nThe dashboard viewer allows defining the scope of data items (threats) to be displayed from the following options:\n\n* A specific team  \n  View only threats associated with apps built by the selected team  \n  ![View Threatscope Bar](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/view-threatscope-bar.png)\n* All my teams  \n  View threats associated with apps built by all teams that the ThreatScope viewer is entitled to access  \n  ![View Threatscope Teamsbar](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/view-threatscope-teamsbar.png)\n* Personal workspace  \n  ![View Threatscope Personalworkspace 0bar](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/view-threatscope-personalworkspace-0bar.png)\n\n### Selecting the Date Range\n\nThe Set Date Range section defines the date range of data items (threats) to be displayed. By default, the date range is set to the last 30 days, but this range can be extended in accordance with the ThreatScope dashboard license.\n\n![Threatscope Daterange](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threatscope-Daterange-650x340.png)\n\n### **Threat Trends**\n\n**Threat Trends** provides valuable insights into the threats your apps are facing, categorized by Appdome\u2019s protection packages.  \nTrack the evolution of mobile threats over various time frames, including total threats detected, the most attacked app, and the predominant attack methods for each protection package.\n\n[![Threat Trends](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Trends.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Trends.png)\n\n**Display Options:**\n\n* You can explore the data in **daily, weekly, or monthly** views.  \n  [![Days Weeks Months](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Days_Weeks_Months.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Days_Weeks_Months.png)\n* The color-coded protection packages at the bottom of the display allow you to filter the data by clicking on them to include or exclude specific packages.[![Threat Trends Edit Protection Packages](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Trends_Edit_Protection_Packages.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Trends_Edit_Protection_Packages.png)\n\n* Hovering over any point in the graph reveals a tooltip with detailed information, including the date or date range, total attacks detected, the top attack method, and the most targeted app.  \n  [![Threat Trends Focus Tooltip](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Trends_Focus_Tooltip.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Trends_Focus_Tooltip.png)\n* **Bot Defense Data \u2013** When selecting this option from the Threat-Inspect\u2122 menu, it adds the MobileBot data to the Threat Trends display.  \n  [Click here to learn more about Appdome\u2019s MobileBOT\u2122 Defense.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/mobilebot-detection/)  \n  [![Bot Defense Data](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bot-Defense-Data-2.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bot-Defense-Data-2.png)[![Threat Trends Mobilebot](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Trends_MobileBot.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Trends_MobileBot.png)\n\n### Reviewing the geographical source of threats\n\nThe GeoSource section displays a map that allows viewing the country from which the attacks originate.  \nCountries are colored based on the volume of threats detected in the region. For clarification, see the legend on the right.\n\n[![Attack Map Threatscope](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Geo_All.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Geo_All.png)\n\nHover over the requested country to see a breakdown of the information by the following items:\n\n* **Country name**\n* **Date Range**  \n  Only threats from the listed date range are aggregated.\n* **Total attacks**  \n  The sum represents all attacks originating from the country over which the mouse hovers.\n* **Top 3 Attacks**  \n  The top attacks for the selected country  \n  [![Attack Map Threatscope tooltip](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Geo_Tooltip.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Geo_Tooltip.png)\n\n**To select one or more countries:**\n\n* To select a single country, click the requested country on the map or choose its corresponding checkbox. To deselect a country, click the checkbox of the already selected country.\n* To select multiple countries, check the boxes next to each requested country.\n* All other ThreatScope displays will update according to the selected countries.  \n  [![Select multiple countries Threatscope](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Geo_Select.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Geo_Select.png)![Country Tab](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/country-tab.png)\n\n**Types of Geography-based data input**\n\nThe following types of geography-based data input exist:\n\n* **Non-specific**  \n  The default data input on Appdome relies on the public IP address captured from its analytics server to map the threat\u2019s location. Given that attackers can mask their public IP using tools such as VPNs and proxies, this data is labeled as \u201cnon-specific,\u201d namely because we cannot always pinpoint the precise source of an attack.\n\n* **Specific**  \n  In this case, the data input is the device\u2019s location data (GPS). However, since accessing location data requires declaring specific permission in the app and user consent, this type of threat geo-source is not the default option and requires opting in when building the app on Appdome.\n\n**Note**:  \nThe app\u2019s developer is responsible for adding the required location permissions and requesting user consent to access the device\u2019s location since Appdome will not add location permissions to the protected app and trigger any access to location data without checking if the user has granted access to their location data.\n\n**What can be inferred from the data**\n\n* **Ability to create a\u00a0focus list of countries that generate\u00a0the most attacks**  \n  Customers that have a web application firewall (WAF) in place can use this data stream to apply different security policies based on the threat landscape of the app and the app\u2019s user base.\n* **Visibility of how the**\u00a0**threat types are distributed within a given country**This can enable tracking which vectors are used by different local and global actors.\n* You can use the [Snapshots](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-xdr/threatscope-snapshots/) feature to download the current view of the selected GeoSource.\n\n### Using the Performance Streams widget\n\nThe Performance Stream Widget displays the distribution of attacks of the selected date range between the various performance streams.\n\n[![Threat Stream Widget](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Stream_Widget.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Threat_Stream_Widget.png)\n\n**What can be inferred from the data?**\n\n* **Evaluate the risk level of released apps**By tracking blocked and app-enforced threats.\n* **Compare intelligence gathered by released apps**With the actual volume of attacks and threats.\n\n**Filtering the display**\n\nClick on any Performance Stream tile to remove the selected performance stream from the filter. You can adjust the filter to view one or multiple Performance Streams.  \nYou can also apply filters by using the left-side menu.\n\nWhen you apply a filter using the Performance Stream widgets, the selected category is highlighted in color, and the unselected categories turn gray. This visual distinction helps you easily identify which filters are active while focusing on the data from the selected category.  \nThe filter is applied on the Geo Source and the Top 10 Defenses displays.\n\n[![Threatscope1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ThreatScope1-1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ThreatScope1-1.png)\n\n### \n\n### Displaying Top Defenses Breakdown\n\nThe Top Defenses section displays a breakdown of the top defenses by app, OS, and manufacturer.\n\n[![Threatscope Defenses By](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ThreatScope_Defenses_By.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ThreatScope_Defenses_By.png)\n\n**What can be inferred from the data?**\n\nThe data displayed in this section allows for the generation of a list of the characteristics of the apps and devices that are most targeted by the attacks.\n\nHover over a graph line in any of the **Top Defenses Breakdown** tiles to display the following breakdown:\n\n* **App/OS/Device**  \n  List the top attack\u2019s identifier.\n* **Total Detected/Protected**  \n  The value of this field represents the number of attacks and threats associated with the performance stream being hovered in the date range listed in the **Date** field.  \n  This field name is **Total Protected** when the trend line relates to performance streams in which Appdome blocked the attack; otherwise, the name is **Total Detected**.\n* **Defense Mode**  \n  See description in section Viewing all attacks.\n* **Threat Event**  \n  See description in section Viewing all attacks.\n\n[![Threatscope Defenses By Tooltips](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ThreatScope_Defenses_By_tooltips.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ThreatScope_Defenses_By_tooltips.png)\n\n### Attacks Breakdown\n\nThe Attacks Breakdown displays the attacks divided by Threat type:\n\n* [ONEShield\u2122 by Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/oneshield-no-code-mobile-rasp-explained/)\n* [Mobile App Security](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/)\n* [Mobile Fraud Detection](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/)\n* [Social Engineering Prevention](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/account-takeover-prevention/social-engineering-prevention/)\n* [Malware Prevention](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/)\n* [Cheat Prevention](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-cheat-prevention/)\n* [Geo Compliance](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/account-takeover-prevention/geo-compliance/)\n* [Anti ATO](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/account-takeover-prevention/)\n* [BOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/)\n\nThe default view, as shown below, displays the group with the most events.

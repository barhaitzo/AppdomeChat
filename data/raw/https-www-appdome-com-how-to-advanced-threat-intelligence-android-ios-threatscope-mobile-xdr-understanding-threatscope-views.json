Furthermore, the platform offers scalability, with the total number of permissible Threat-Views being defined by the user\u2019s license tier.\n\n**Note:** Threat-Views are not shareable and can only be accessed by the view\u2019s creator.\n\n## **How to create Threat-Views:**\n\n1. Access the *ThreatScope Dashboard* by selecting from the left side menu.  \n   [![Appdome Left Side Main Menu](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Appdome_Left_Side_Main_Menu.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Appdome_Left_Side_Main_Menu.png)\n2. Select the workspace you want the Threat-Views to be associated with.  \n   ![Workspacetobeassociated2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-08-10-at-13.32.png)\n3. Apply the filters for the Threat-View by selecting or clearing items in the *Filter Pane*.  \n   After a change to a filter is applied, the filter section will be highlighted as such.  \n   [![Standard Views](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Standard-Views.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Standard-Views.png)  \n   This Filter indicator shows how many changes were applied to the Threat-Views filter. Clicking on the **Revert** button restores the original state of the selection filter. If changes were made to a Threat-View, clicking this button will revert back to the last saved state of the Threat-View. Otherwise, the filter will be restored to its default state.  \n   [![Advanced Filters Applied](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Advanced-Filters-Applied.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Advanced-Filters-Applied.png)\n4. To create a view, click **+** **Create View**.  \n   ![Threatscope Createview Button ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/create-view-button.png)\n5. Use the *Create View* dialog box to enter the Threat-View name in the relevant field, and ensure that the workspace being used is correct.  \n   ![Create View Dialog Box](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Create-View-dialog-box.png)  \n   Note:  \n   Ensure that you enter a unique name. If the name you entered matches an existing Threat-View, the notification shown below will be displayed.  \n   ![Create View Dialog Box 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Create-View-dialog-box-2-e1696258709848.png)\n6. When done, click **Create View**.  \n   ![Create View Button](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/create-view-button-1.png)  \n   A notification is displayed in the top right corner when the view is created.  \n   ![Successfullycreated 8](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/successfullycreated-8-2.png)  \n   The View ThreatScope section displays the name of the newly created view.  \n   ![View 9](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-08-10-at-12.52.png)\n7. To navigate between Threat-Views and workspaces, use the scope list to select the view to present.  \n   You can set a view as a favorite by clicking on the star icon on the right.  \n   ![Setviewasfavorite10](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SetViewAsFavorite10.png)  \n   The Threat-View or workspace selected as the favorite will become the default Threat-View when accessing ThreatScope.\n\n## Updating\u00a0Threat-Views\n\nThe filters saved for Threat-Views can be updated after the Threat-View is created  \nWhen the Threat-View filter is modified from its last saved state, the Save View\u00a0 menu allows performing either of the following operations:\n\n* Creating a new Threat-View by using the updated filters\n* Updating the existing Threat-View\n\n![Save View Drop](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/save-view-drop.png)\n\nAfter updating the Threat-View, the following notification indicates that the view was successfully updated.\n\n![00000](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/00000.png)\n\n## Deleting Threat-Views\n\n**To delete Threat-Views:**\n\n1. Navigate to the Threat-View to be removed by clicking and scrolling down the scope drop-down list.  \n   ![scope drop-down list](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-08-10-at-12.52-1.png)\n2. Hover over the Threat-View to be deleted and click the **Delete View**\u00a0icon.  \n   ![Deleteview13](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/deleteview13.png)  \n   When prompted to confirm or reject the Threat-View deletion, click either **Yes, Delete View** to remove the view, or **No, Keep as is** reject the deletion.  \n   ![Threatscope Deleteview](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/threatscope-deleteview.png)  \n   After deleting the Threat-View, the following notification indicates that the Threat-View was successfully removed.  \n   ![Viewdeletenotifaicition145](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/viewdeletenotifaicition145.png)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [Understanding ThreatScope](/how-to/mobile-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-threat-intelligence-center/understanding-threatscope/)\n* [How to Use ThreatScope\u2122 User Remediation Center](/how-to/mobile-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threatscope-mobile-threat-intelligence-center/remediation-center/)\n* [Threat Events in Android & iOS Apps Explained](/how-to/mobile-threat-intelligence-android-ios/mobile-threat-events-android-ios/threat-events-in-android-ios-apps-explained/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1679908741342.1680075003029.1680514110749.4&__hssc=79098507.12.1680514110749&__hsfp=1707508022)!

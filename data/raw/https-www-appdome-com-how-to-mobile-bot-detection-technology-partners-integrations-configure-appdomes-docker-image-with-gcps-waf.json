When combined with Appdome\u2019s [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/) solution, businesses can achieve an unparalleled level of protection for their mobile applications. This article will guide you on configuring **Google Cloud Platform**\u00a0to connect to a WAF so it can work seamlessly with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense.\n\nBefore delving into the steps, let\u2019s understand some of the terms used:\n\n**MTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security):**\u00a0Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a method for mutual authentication in which both parties in a network connection validate the SSL certificates presented by each other against a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.\n\n**Client Certificate:**\u00a0In cryptography, a client certificate is a type of digital certificate that is used by client systems to make authenticated requests to a remote server.\n\n**Safe Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are determined to be safe or not at risk of any threat.\n\n**At Risk Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are potentially under threat or have detected anomalies.\n\n**Header Payload:**\u00a0The data transferred in the header of HTTP requests or responses. Protecting this data ensures that it cannot be tampered with during transit.\n\n### Prerequisites For Using GCP & Appdome Docker Image\n\nIn order to use the GCP Virtual Server in conjunction with Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* A GCP account with admin permissions\n* A GCP\u00a0server\n* An Android or iOS app secured by Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense\n* An Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense License\n\n## Getting Started with GCP Setup and Configuration\n\n### Set up a Linux Server on GCP\n\n1. **Create a Project**\n   * Navigate to the ***GCP Console***.\n   * Click on the project drop-down and create a new project.\n2. **Enable Compute Engine API**\n\n   * In the GCP Console, navigate to \u201c***APIs & Services***\u201d > \u201c***Dashboard***\u201c\n   * Click on \u201c***+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES***\u201d and search for \u201c***Compute Engine API***\u201d Enable it for your project.\n3. **Create a Virtual Machine (VM)**\n\n   * In the GCP Console, navigate to \u201c***Compute Engine***\u201d > \u201c***VM instances***\u201c\n   * Click on \u201c***Create Instance***\u201c\n   * Configure your VM instance, including selecting the Linux distribution you prefer (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).  \n     **Note:** Make sure to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic when configuring the firewall rules.\n\n### Connect SSH to your VM\n\n```\ngcloud compute ssh YOUR_VM_NAME\n```\n\n### Running a Docker Container on GCP\n\nTo learn more, see the installation instructions for [Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)\n\n## Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image\n\nAfter setting up your server of choice, proceed to configure the Appdome Docker Image as outlined in our dedicated knowledge base article, [How to Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/configure-appdomes-docker-image/).\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* + [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/)\n  + [Using F5 WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrating-f5-waf-with-appdome-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n  + [Using Akamai WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrate-appdomes-docker-image-with-akamais-waf-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)!

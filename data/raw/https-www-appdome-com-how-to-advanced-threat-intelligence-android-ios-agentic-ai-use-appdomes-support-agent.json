It introduces an intuitive, interactive approach to investigating and resolving mobile threats.  \nEach time a security protection triggers inside a mobile app, Appdome generates a ThreatCode\u2122\u2014a unique identifier that captures the precise protection triggered, the reason for the trigger, and the device, OS, and environment in which it occurred. The Support Agent turns this raw ThreatCode\u2122 into clear, actionable guidance explaining the threat, how to find it on the device, and how to disable or remove it.\n\nThe Support Agent is designed for support, engineering, SecOps, fraud, and mobile operations teams who need to resolve mobile security issues faster and with greater confidence.\n\n## Benefits of Appdome\u2019s Support Agent.\n\n**Faster Threat Resolution**  \nThe Support Agent transforms diagnostic threat data into step-by-step instructions so teams can resolve issues quickly and accurately.\n\n**Reduced Support Burden**  \nBy automating investigation and explanation, support teams spend less time diagnosing device conditions and more time resolving user issues.\n\n**Threat-, Device-, and OS-Specific Guidance**  \nResponses are tailored to the specific device, OS version, and detected attack, ensuring accuracy and relevance.\n\n**Conversational Insight**  \nTeams can ask unlimited follow-up questions about the threat, what triggered it, and how to resolve it.\n\n**Secure, Guarded Interactions**  \nThe Support Agent uses Appdome\u2019s RAG-based architecture with strict guardrails to ensure responses are safe, correct, and limited to the active ThreatCode\u2122 session.\n\n### What Is a ThreatCode\u2122?\n\nA ThreatCode\u2122 is a unique identifier automatically generated when an Appdome protection detects or blocks a threat at runtime.\n\nEach ThreatCode\u2122\u00a0maps directly to:\n\n* The specific protection triggered (e.g., Rooted Device, Hooking Framework, SSL Bypass)\n* The operating system and version\n* The device make and model\n* The environmental condition or attack that caused the detection\n\nYou can think of it as the diagnostic fingerprint of a single security event on a device.\n\nAll Support Agent conversations begin with a ThreatCode\u2122.\n\nThe ThreatCode\u2122\u00a0is 14 characters (4 + 4 + 6), for example;\n\n[![Threat Event Samples](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Threat_Event_Samples-1.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Threat_Event_Samples-1.png)\n\n**ThreatEvent Metadata**\n\nThe ThreatCode\u2122\u00a0is comprised of the context Keys in the ThreatEvent Metadata\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ReasonCode | 4 bytes: Reason code of the occurred event |\n| fusedAppToken | 4 bytes: the first 4 characters of the build or task ID, also called the \u201cfuse token\u201d) |\n| ThreatCode\u2122 | 6 bytes: also called the eventcode (the actual \u201cthreat code\u201d) |\n\n`{reasonCode} : {taskID} : {EventCode}`\n\nOnce entered, the Support Agent automatically loads the associated threat context and begins the dialogue.\n\n### Navigating the Support Agent\n\n[![Support Agent](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Support_Agent-2.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Support_Agent-2.png)\n\nThe Support Agent interface is divided into two primary areas:\n\n**Left Pane: ThreatCode**\u2122 **History & Collaboration Panel**  \nThis pane helps teams manage and collaborate on past and current threat investigations.\n\nIt includes:\n\n* ThreatCodes List  \n  All ThreatCodes previously submitted by the team. Each entry shows summary details (attack type, date, context).\n* Filters & Sorting  \n  Filter ThreatCodes tagged with your username  \n  Sort by Date or Attack Type\n* Endorsing ThreatCodes (\u201cHeart\u201d Icon)  \n  Use this when you believe a ThreatCode\u2122\u2014or the conversation around it\u2014should be seen by others.\n* Company Tagging  \n  Tag teammates to bring them into a conversation about a specific ThreatCode\u2122.\n* Your Agents Tab  \n  A list of ThreatCodes you personally submitted and ThreatCodes where you continued the conversation with follow-up questions\n* Download Remediation Steps  \n  Download the complete summary and remediation details for any ThreatCode\u2122.\n\n**Right Pane: Conversation Panel**  \nThis is where the Support Agent provides guidance, answers questions, and walks you through understanding and resolving the threat.\n\n### How to Use the Support Agent\n\n1. **Log in** to Your Appdome Account\n2. Use your standard credentials to access the **AI Agents**.\n3. Open the **Support Agent \u2013** Click the **Support Agent** button from the Main Menu on the Landing Page.\n4. Enter a **ThreatCode\u2122**\n5. Start the Conversation  \n   After entering the ThreatCode press Enter.  \n   The Support Agent will present a structured response divided into three sections:\n\n**1. What the Threat Is**\n\n* + - What triggered the detection\n    - What is it and why it matters\n    - Impact on app integrity, user safety, or device security\n    - Additional relevant context (e.g., rooting tools, instrumentation frameworks, MITM activity)\n\n**2. How to Find the Threat on the Device**Three methods are provided:  \nTypically broken down into 3 difficulty levels dependent on the identified threat.\n\n* + - **Easiest:** Non-technical steps (e.g., check settings, review installed apps)\n    - **Medium:** Intermediate steps (e.g., validating system state, checking developer settings)\n    - **Expert:** Advanced steps (e.g., ADB commands)\n\n**3. How to Disable or Remove the Threat**Three methods are provided for guidance broken down into 3 difficulty levels based on the identified threat.\n\n* + - **Easiest:** Basic removal actions\n    - **Medium:** More involved settings and cleanup\n    - **Expert:** Technical or command-line steps for hardened cases\n\n**4. Download Remediation Details**Download your remediation details as a PDF for documentation, compliance, or sharing purposes. This helps providing detailed information about the Threat but also how to find and remove them from the device.\n\n**5. Ask Follow-Up Questions**You can ask the Support Agent any question related to the **current ThreatCode**, such as:\n\n* + - \u201cWhat should I do next?\u201d\n    - \u201cHow did this threat get on the device?\u201d\n    - \u201cShould the user be concerned?\u201d\n    - \u201cIs the device compromised?\u201d\n    - \u201cThese steps didn\u2019t work\u2014what else can I try?\u201d\n\nThe Support Agent will **only** answer questions related to the active ThreatCode.  \nTo investigate a different threat, click **new** to start a new session.\n\n### Guardrails & Privacy\n\n**Enterprise-Grade Guardrails**\n\nAll Appdome AI Agents operate entirely inside Appdome\u2019s secure enterprise framework. Every interaction and workflow is governed by strict security, privacy, and compliance controls to ensure safe, auditable use of AI in enterprise environments.\n\nAppdome ensures the following:\n\n* No threat telemetry, device data, or customer information is ever shared with public AI systems\n* No PII is processed, stored, or used by any Appdome AI Agent\n* All agent actions and responses follow Appdome audit and access controls\n* External reasoning components operate under strict No-Learning and No-Retention policies, preventing any data persistence or model training\n* All intelligence remains tenant-scoped, ensuring complete isolation between customer tenants\n\nThese guardrails ensure safe and governed use of AI for Appdome customers.\n\n**Context-Engineered Intelligence**\n\nAppdome\u2019s AI Agents do not rely on generic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approaches or public datasets. Instead, Appdome uses a Context Engineering approach that synthesizes Appdome-governed threat telemetry, build context, historical intelligence, and enrichment data *before* any reasoning occurs.\n\nThis approach replaces traditional retrieval-based techniques and ensures all reasoning is grounded exclusively in Appdome-governed, tenant-specific context.\n\nThis ensures that:\n\n* Insights are accurate, explainable, consistent, and reproducible\n* Responses reflect real mobile events, not generalized assumptions\n* Threat analysis, remediation guidance, and recommendations remain aligned with each customer\u2019s apps, defenses, and active threat surface\n* No public data sources or external information feeds shape the agent\u2019s intelligence\n\nAll outputs are derived exclusively from verified, internal, tenant-scoped data.\n\n### Managing ThreatCodes and Conversations\n\n[![Manage Conversatins](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Manage_Conversatins.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Manage_Conversatins.png)\n\n**1. Endorsing ThreatCodes (Heart Icon)**\n\nThe Heart icon allows you to publicly endorse a ThreatCode\u2122. This is not a personal favorite list and cannot be used for sorting.  \nInstead, clicking the Heart:\n\n* Signals to your team that this ThreatCode\u2122 is important, useful, or noteworthy\n* Helps highlight active or relevant investigations for other users\n* Makes the ThreatCode\u2122 more visible across team and company views\n\nUse this when you believe a ThreatCode\u2122\u2014or the conversation around it\u2014should be seen by others.\n\n**2. Tag Teammates & Start a Conversation (Chat Icon)**\n\nInvite colleagues into a threat investigation by tagging them from the list.\n\n**3. Filters & Sorting**\n\n* Filter to show ThreatCodes where you were tagged\n* Sort by Date or Attack Type\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Support Agent provides a faster, more intuitive, AI-guided method for understanding and resolving mobile security threats. With its ThreatCode**\u2122**-driven workflow, structured guidance, team collaboration features, and secure conversational model, it helps teams resolve issues faster and with greater confidence.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to use Appdome\u2019s AI Agent Team](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/agentic-ai/use-appdomes-ai-agent-team/)\n* [How To Use Appdome\u2019s Mobile Risk Index\u2122 (MRI)](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/agentic-ai/use-appdomes-mobile-risk-index-mri/)\n* [How To use No-Code Security for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/using-no-code-security-for-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How To Get Started with Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/getting-started-with-appdome/)\n* [How To Release Secured Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/releasing-secured-android-ios-apps/)\n* [Appdome Support Levels Overview](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/appdome-support-levels-overview/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

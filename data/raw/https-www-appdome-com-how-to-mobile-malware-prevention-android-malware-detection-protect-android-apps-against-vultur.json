This malware often masquerades as legitimate apps, tricking users through social engineering techniques like pretexting to gain initial access and permission to install. Once installed, Vultur can remotely control the device, intercept SMS messages (including MFA codes), and capture login credentials by recording on-screen activity. The malware uses encryption to conceal its operations, making detection challenging and allowing it to bypass conventional anti-malware measures. By operating under the guise of authentic apps, Vultur effectively bypasses traditional defenses, compromising user credentials, financial transactions, and personal data.\n\n## Why protect mobile apps from Vultur?\n\nDefending against Vultur is critical because it combines multiple attack vectors\u2014remote access, SMS/MFA code interception, and social engineering\u2014to compromise user data across banking, social media, and other sensitive applications. Vultur\u2019s use of social engineering through fake, legitimate-looking apps and pretexting tactics increases the likelihood of user consent, enabling the malware to gain full access to critical functions like SMS and screen recording. This allows attackers to capture authentication codes, hijack accounts, and conceal malicious activities under encryption layers, making detection and remediation harder. Mitigating such threats is essential for maintaining app integrity, user privacy, and preventing financial and reputational damage, particularly in regulated sectors where compliance and data protection standards are mandatory.\n\n## **How does Appdome protect against Vultur?**\n\nYou can protect mobile apps against Vultur malware using the following Appdome protections:\n\n* **[RASP](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/)** \u2013 Prevents Vultur from injecting itself into installed apps & repackaging them. Also includes anti-tampering, anti-debugging, anti-emulator & other protections against dynamic runtime attacks.\n* [**Code Obfuscation**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-code-obfuscation/)\u00a0\u2013 Protects against decompiling and malicious reverse engineering.\n* [**Root Detection**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/jailbreak-root-detection/build-root-detection-protect-android-apps/) \u2013 Protects app from running on rooted Android device.

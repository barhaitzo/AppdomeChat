This Knowledge Base article reviews in detail how users can leverage Threat-Events to respond or enforce actions after Appdome detects a security event in a mobile app.\n\n## About Appdome Mobile App Threat-Events\n\nAppdome Threat-Events use industry-standard notification methods to pass events from the Appdome layer back to the application so that the application can take further action whenever Appdome detects malicious events against an Appdome-protected app.\n\nWhen Appdome detects a security event, the event can be handled in one of the following ways:\n\n**In-App Detection**\n\nAppdome detects the attack or threat and passes the event in a standard format to the app for processing (your app chooses how and when to enforce).\n\n**In-App Defense**\n\nWhen Appdome detects a security violation performed on the app, it will pass the event from the Appdome layer to the app. Appdome\u2019s security engine will handle the event. The default behavior is for the app to exit after displaying a compromise notification to the end user (compromise notifications are customizable).\n\n**Enforce Connection Only** (for [Secure Communication/MitM Attack Prevention](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/no-code-mobile-app-mitm-resources/) and [Secure Certificate Pinning](/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-man-in-the-middle-prevention/use-secure-certificate-pinning-prevent-mitm-attacks/) only):\n\nWhen Appdome detects a security event, it passes the event from the Appdome layer to the app and blocks the connection that triggered the event.\n\nBy design, when the mobile application registers to receive Appdome Threat Events, Appdome will send an initial event. If Appdome detects a security event during the app launch/run, the initial event will hold the triggered security event details. If no security event is triggered, the initial event will only indicate a successful registration to Appdome Threat-Events (the event fields will hold no data).\n\n### Threat-Event Failsafe Enforcement\n\nWhen the **Failsafe Enforcement** toggle is enabled, the selected In-App Detection Threat Event undergoes a hardening process. Appdome not only sends threat data to the app but also implements delayed enforcement against the identified threat. This mode grants the protected app the ability to manage the user experience (UX) when informing the end user about the threat while delegating the actual enforcement to Appdome.\n\nFor more details, please see [How to Implement Failsafe Enforcement with In-App Detection](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/use-in-app-detection-with-failsafe-enforcement-in-mobile-apps/).\n\n![Failsafe Enforcement](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Toggle-Root-Detection.png)\n\n### About Appdome Threat-Event Score\n\nAppdome **Threat-Event Score** is used for advanced threat handling and response. With Threat-Event Score, you can configure each **Threat-Event** with a unique score in order to value the importance of a particular threat or prioritize how threats are handled after Appdome detects a threat.\n\nRisk scoring allows users to evaluate threats based on multiple selected Threats at a given time. By assigning a risk weight to each Threat Event, you can prioritize its importance in the total risk assessment.\n\nAppdome divides Threats into two groups: consistent and volatile. Consistent events affect the total score for the entire session of the app, while volatile events only affect the total score for a short period. Consistent events include root detection and tampering with the app. All other events are considered volatile.\n\nWhen activating the Threat-Event Score toggle on Appdome, you can set a numerical value (between 1-1000) that you can set for each applicable Threat-Event for any Android or iOS app. This additional scoring attribute is passed as part of an Appdome Threat Event. Threat-Event Score attributes are persistent (i.e., fixed) in each mobile app build. To update a Threat Score to reflect a new risk profile for the app or a given threat, you can re-build the app with a new Threat-Event Score on Appdome.\n\nThe Threat-Event Score can be set or adjusted according to a user-defined risk model. Threat-Event Scores can be assigned to multiple threats, allowing you to set a threshold for when a security action or workflow will be taken. With Threat-Event Score, developers are enabled to customize the enforcement model and tailor the user experience according to the relative or absolute importance, criticality, or severity level of each threat.\n\n### How to Implement Appdome Mobile App Threat-Events in Android and iOS Apps\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to implement Appdome\u00a0**Threat Events** in any iOS or Android app. Two examples are provided below. For each Appdome security protection that includes Threat Events, follow the instructions in the knowledge-based article, which provides code samples.\n\nNote: For instructions about implementing threat events in Java code, see the Knowledge Base article [Implementing Threat Events in Code](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-threat-intelligence-android-ios/mobile-threat-events-android-ios/implementing-threat-events-in-code/).\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome Mobile App Threat-Events\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/) \u2013 Appdome DEV or Higher.\n* [Threat-Events license](/appdome-pricing/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Enabling Threat-Events\n\nAfter uploading your app to Appdome, select the \u2018Security\u2019 tab.

Using Fastly\u2019s WAF with Appdome\u2019s [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/) solution offers app developers a streamlined approach to protect backend APIs against malicious bots and botnets, credential stuffing attacks, DDoS, invalid traffic and other automated attacks. In this guide, you\u2019ll learn how to integrate **Appdome\u2019s Docker Image** with **Fastly\u2019s WAF**.\n\nBefore delving into the steps, let\u2019s understand some of the terms used:\n\n**MTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security):**\u00a0Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a method for mutual authentication in which both parties in a network connection validate the SSL certificates presented by each other against a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.\n\n**Client Certificate:**\u00a0In cryptography, a client certificate is a type of digital certificate that is used by client systems to make authenticated requests to a remote server.\n\n**Safe Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are determined to be safe or not at risk of any threat.\n\n**At Risk Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are potentially under threat or have detected anomalies.\n\n**Header Payload:**\u00a0The data transferred in the header of HTTP requests or responses. Protecting this data ensures that it cannot be tampered with during transit.\n\nWhen Appdome\u2019s code is integrated into the Virtual Server, it enhances the firewall\u2019s capability to determine the validity of a session. To categorize sessions as \u201cSafe Session\u201d or \u201cAt Risk Session\u201d, Appdome\u2019s code analyzes specific headers within incoming requests: Timestamp, Nonce, and SignedMessage. The Timestamp header allows Appdome\u2019s code to detect potential delay attacks by comparing the request\u2019s timestamp with the server\u2019s time. The Nonce, a unique random value, ensures the uniqueness of each request, protecting against replay attacks. The SignedMessage, typically an RSA-encrypted SHA256 hash of the timestamp, nonce, and a shared secret, ensures the integrity of the request.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Fastly & Appdome Docker Image\n\nFor utilizing Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense with Fastly, you\u2019ll need the following:\n\n* A Fastly account with admin permissions\n* An AWS, GCP, or Azure server with admin permissions\n* An Android or iOS app secured by Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense\n* An Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense License\n\n## Getting Started with Fastly\u2019s WAF Setup and Configuration\n\n**Note:** For any additional information, please refer to Fastly\u2019s\u00a0 documentation on\n\n1. **Upload a TLS certificate**\n   * [Cloud WAF Certificate Management](https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/cloud-waf-certificate-management)\n   * Keep in mind that, for requests coming from Fastly\u2019s Edge, you can use a Fastly-managed TLS certificate instead when you create a Cloud WAF instance. In this case, uploading a TLS certificate is optional.\n2. **Create a Cloud WAF Instance**\n   * See the Fastly\u2019s guide on how to [Create a Cloud Waf Instance](https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/cloud-waf-instance-management#creating-a-cloud-waf-instance)\n3. **Setup a Site Rule**\n   * Learn more about [Site Rules](https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/about-the-rules-menu#about-the-site-rules-page)\n4. **mTLS Configuration**\n   * [Setting up Mutual TLS Authentication](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/setting-up-mutual-tls-authentication)\n\n* **IMPORTANT:** It is only necessary to configure the mTLS if you have\u00a0enabled mTLS in the Appdome Build process. Otherwise, skip ahead to the section *\u201c**Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image*****\u201c**\n\n### Setting up the server of your choice\n\nWhen the Fastly configuration has been completed, you can begin setting up up your GCP, Azure or AWS sever or any cloud provider of your choice.\n\n**Links to Dedicated Appdome Knowledge Base articles**:\n\n* **GCP**: For setting up a server on Google Cloud Platform and configuring it with **Appdome\u2019s Docker Image**, [follow this guide](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/configure-appdomes-docker-image-with-gcps-waf/).\n* **Azure**: For setting up a server on Microsoft Azure and configuring it with **Appdome\u2019s Docker Image**, [follow this guide](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/integrating-azure-waf-with-appdome-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/).\n* **AWS**: For setting up a server on Amazon Web Services and configuring it with **Appdome\u2019s Docker Image**, [follow this guide.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/integrate-appdomes-waf-with-aws/)\n\nTo learn more, see the installation instructions for\u00a0[Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)\n\n## Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image\n\nAfter setting up your server of choice, proceed to configure the Appdome Docker Image as outlined in our dedicated knowledge base article,\u00a0[How to Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/configure-appdomes-docker-image/).\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/)\n* [Using Akamai WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrate-appdomes-docker-image-with-akamais-waf-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps in Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/use-appdome-build-2secure-in-azure-pipelines/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)\n* [Using F5 WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrating-f5-waf-with-appdome-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)!

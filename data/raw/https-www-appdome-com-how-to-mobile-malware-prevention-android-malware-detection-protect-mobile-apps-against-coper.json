Designed to exploit mobile banking apps, Coper intercepts credentials, SMS messages, and one-time passwords (OTPs), bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to gain unauthorized account access. Once active, it performs a range of malicious actions, including capturing login details, intercepting SMS-based MFA codes, and initiating unauthorized fund transfers without user involvement. By mimicking legitimate user actions, Coper evades detection and facilitates account takeovers. Its ability to disguise itself as a legitimate app and adapt to bypass new security measures makes it highly effective and challenging to defend against in real time.\n\n## Why Protect Mobile Apps Against **Coper**?\n\nMitigating Coper is essential to prevent serious risks, including credential theft, unauthorized transactions, and account takeovers. This malware\u2019s ability to intercept SMS messages and MFA codes presents a direct risk to user security and compliance with financial security regulations. Furthermore, Coper\u2019s use of Accessibility Services to gain deep access to device functions and execute commands makes it particularly dangerous for high-value transactions and data-sensitive applications. Protecting against Coper is critical for maintaining secure user interactions and preventing fraudulent activity that could undermine both user safety and regulatory compliance.\n\n## How Does Appdome Protect Against\u00a0**Coper**?\n\nTaking all the above into consideration, you can use Appdome to protect against **Coper** using a combination of following protection methods:\n\n* **[RASP](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/)** \u2013 Prevents Coper from injecting itself into installed apps and repackaging them.\n* [**Code Obfuscation**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-code-obfuscation/)\u00a0\u2013 Protects against decompiling and malicious reverse engineering.\n* [**Root Detection**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/jailbreak-root-detection/build-root-detection-protect-android-apps/)\u00a0\u2013 Protects app from running on rooted Android device.\n* [**MitM Attack Prevention**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/use-android-tls-ssl-certificate-validation-prevent-mitm-attacks/) \u2013 Prevents Coper from intercepting or hijacking sessions to steal data.\n* [**Block App Overlay Attacks**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/ato-prevention/protect-android-apps-from-overlay-attacks-malware/) \u2013 Detects and prevents fake/malicious screen overlays from displaying on top of the app screen and concealing the legitimate app screen.\n* [**Keylogging Prevention**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/ato-prevention/protect-android-ios-apps-from-keylogging-malware/) \u2013 Prevents the use of malicious keyloggers which may be used to intercept two-factor authentication codes or harvest sensitive information.\n* [**Prevent Accessibility Services Malware**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/ato-prevention/prevent-accessibility-service-malware-on-android-apps/) \u2013 Detects and prevents malicious actions against mobile apps and users undertaken by malware and malware families that abuses Android AccessibilityService in mobile apps.\n* **[Google Play Store Signature Validation](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/social-engineering-prevention/use-google-play-signature-validation-to-prevent-fake-apps-mods/)** \u2013 Protects against fake apps, clones, masquerading.\n* [**Prevent ATS Malware**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-malware-prevention/android-malware-detection/prevent-ats-malware/)\u00a0\u2013 Detect active transaction hijacking attempts, blocks the attempt, provide a notification to the end user.\n\nEach of the protections above are linked to the relevant knowledge base article for that feature, which

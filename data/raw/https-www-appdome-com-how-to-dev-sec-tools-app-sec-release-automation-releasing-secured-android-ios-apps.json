Using a simple point-and-click user interface, Appdome enables anyone to add new features, services, SDKs and APIs to any iOS and Android apps in seconds without coding. Appdome customers simply upload an app binary, select the services they wish to implement, and click\u00a0 \u201cBuild My App\u201d.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. Customers merely upload an Android or iOS app binary (signed or unsigned), select the security features, SDKs, or mobile services they want to implement and click \u201cBuild My App\u201d.\n\nAfter selecting your services and clicking \u201cBuild My App\u201d, you will see the following message in about 30 seconds.\n\n![Success Msg](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Success_MSG-650x362.png)\n\nThis means that you have successfully Built your app on Appdome (ie: you have successfully implemented all the new features or services you selected during the BUILD phase, and the Appdome platform has produced a new app binary).\u00a0 Before you can deploy your new Appdome-Built app, you need to sign the app. Before you sign your new app, you can add additional customizations, branding or other configuration elements within the Context\u2122\u00a0 part of the workflow (optional).\n\nBelow are the steps to complete your mobile integration product after you successfully built your app on Appdome:\n\n## How to Complete Appdome Projects \u2013 Releasing Secured iOS and Android apps\n\n### Adding Context\u2122 to Secured mobile apps for Branding, Configuration, Customization (optional)\n\nAfter Building an app, customers can customize an Appdome-built app under the\u00a0 Context\u2122 tab on the Appdome platform. For example, you can brand your new app with your logo, add a private or custom login URL, customize the app configuration, add key/value pairs and more. Context\u2122 also enables enterprise customers to auto-deploy Appdome-built apps to their existing enterprise infrastructure without changing or reconfiguring any backend services.\n\nRead this article for more information on the range of [options available in Context](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps/)\u2122.\n\n### Signing Secured iOS and Android Apps (required)\n\nIn order to deploy an app you built on Appdome, you need to sign the new application.\u00a0 [Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode ) and [Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) is simple and error-free on Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign it locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploying Secured Mobile Apps(optional)\n\nOnce you have signed your new app, you can deploy it using your distribution method of choice, which you can read about in [Auto-Deploying Mobile Apps Using Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [**support.appdome.com**](http://support.appdome.com/ \"http://support.appdome.com/\") or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

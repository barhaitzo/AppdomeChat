Secure mobile data in transit fast and easy. Per App VPN Routing is a feature supplied by Apple\u2019s iOS to tunnel connections through a VPN.\n\nThe only way to configure Per-App VPN is by enrolling the device in a Mobile Device Management (MDM) system and linking apps that are managed by the MDM system with a VPN configuration. The app\u2019s traffic will then be handled by Apple\u2019s VPN component.\n\n## How to Make iOS Apps Work with Per App VPN\n\nTo enable this feature in your mobile app using Appdome:\n\n1. Go to the Build Tab\n2. Select the Access menu\n3. Turn on\u00a0Per-App VPN Routing\n\n![Per App VPN routing switch](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PerAppVPNRouting.png)\n\n4. You will see a warning message that other features are being disabled. Click Proceed.\n\n![Per App VPN routing warning](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PerAppVPNRouting_2.png)\n\n### Per App VPN Routing Compatibility\n\nTo allow this feature to handle the traffic, the following Appdome features will be turned off automatically, or an error will be displayed\n\n* [Mobile Access and MicroVPN Profiles](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/use-in-app-micro-vpn-remote-access-mobile-apps/)\n* [Any non-NTLM Authentication Profiles](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-mobile-sso/use-enterprise-authentication-mobile-apps/)\n* [Identity services](https://www.appdome.com/knowledgebase-category/mobile-identity/)\n* [IP Address Visibility](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/appdomes-comprehensive-mobile-security-suite/)\n* [URL Whitelisting](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/connect-to-trusted-mobile-hosts-with-url-whitelisting/)\n* [Proxy Settings](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/add-proxy-pac-routing-enterprise-mobile-apps/)\n\nEven if you tunnel an app\u2019s entire network connectivity, you are still able to secure your app by using complementary Appdome features such as:\n\n1.

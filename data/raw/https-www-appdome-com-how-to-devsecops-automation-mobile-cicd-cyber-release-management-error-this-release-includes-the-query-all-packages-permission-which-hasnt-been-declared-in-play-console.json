One such permission is `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`, which can inadvertently cause problems during the upload or testing phases of Google Play Store submission.\n\nThere are two scenarios where this issue can arise:\n\n1. **If your app originally included the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` Permission**:  \n   The app will pass the upload stage but fail during Google\u2019s internal stability tests, which prevents it from being published. Google uses RoboTest to perform sanity tests; Appdome purposely injects a detection method that shows the app is running on RoboTest and crashes the app. This is done to prevent secured Appdome apps that include exposed diagnostic logs from being uploaded and published to the Google PlayStore.  \n   ![Screenshot 2024 09 15 At 15.33.07 (1)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-15-at-15.33.07-1.png)\n2. **If your app does not initially include `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` but it is added after using Appdome\u2019s Diagnostic Logs feature**:  \n   In this case, the app will fail at the upload stage itself and show the error mentioned above.\n\n### How to Resolve This Issue\n\nTo resolve this error and successfully publish the app:\n\n1. Remove the **Diagnostic Logs** feature from the Appdome fusion.\n2. Rebuild the app without the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission.\n3. Re-upload the app to the Google Play Console.\n\nBy doing this, the app will no longer include the permission that caused the failure, allowing it to pass both the upload and stability testing phases in Google Play.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Auto Publish Secured iOS Apps to Apple App Store](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/auto-publish-secured-ios-apps-to-apple-app-store/)\n* [How to Auto Publish Secured Android Apps to Google Play](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/auto-publish-secured-android-apps-to-google-play/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.6.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.6.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)!

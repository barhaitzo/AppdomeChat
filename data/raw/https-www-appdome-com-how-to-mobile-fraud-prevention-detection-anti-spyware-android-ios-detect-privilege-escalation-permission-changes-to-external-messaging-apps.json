When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App\u201d, Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured apps. There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\nBlock mobile app permission to external messaging apps is part of [Mobile Permission Control](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/control-app-permissions-android-ios-apps/) which can be found in the\u00a0[Appdome Mobility Suite](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/cyber-security-compliance/guarantee-android-ios-compatibility-uem-mam/)\u00a0under the Management tab.\n\nWhen you Add Ability to Use In-App Messages Only to Mobile Apps, the app can not display alternate messaging apps when contact is clicked within the app. For more information on these types of controls, check out this [blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/control-app-permissions-android-ios-apps ).\n\n## Prerequisites for Adding In-App Messages Only Functionality\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher.\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android) Have the app file available for Fusion on your computer.\n* [Appdome-GO access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-go-secure-enterprise-mobile-apps/)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/automated-code-signing-options-secured-android-ios-apps)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Block Mobile App Permission to External Messaging Apps\n\nTo add\u00a0In-App Messages Only to Any Mobile App:\n\n1.

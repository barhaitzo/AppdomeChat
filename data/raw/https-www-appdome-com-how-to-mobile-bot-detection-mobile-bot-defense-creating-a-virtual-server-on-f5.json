This guide will cover creating nodes and pools to facilitate traffic distribution and load balancing.\n\n## **Prerequisites**\n\nIn order to use the F5 Anti Bot verification app in conjunction with Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* A configured and accessible BIG-IP server\n* A server protected by F5\u2019s BIG-IP\n\n## Definitions\n\n* **Node**: A server with an IP address that processes incoming network traffic.\n* **Pool**: A collection of nodes that work together to provide high availability and redundancy. Pools use load-balancing methods to distribute incoming traffic evenly among nodes, improving network efficiency and reliability.\n* **FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)**: This refers to the complete domain name for a specific server or host on the Internet. It includes both the domain name and it can be used in lieu of an IP address for setting up network nodes.\n\n## Steps to Create a Virtual Server\n\n1. 1. **Access the BIG-IP Configuration Utility**:\n      * Log in to your F5 BIG-IP system.\n      * Navigate to the \u2018Local Traffic\u2019 section in the main menu.\n   2. **Open the Virtual Servers Configuration**:\n      * Select \u2018Virtual Servers\u2019 from the sub-menu under \u2018Local Traffic\u2019.\n      * Click on the \u2018Create'(+) button to start the setup of a new virtual server.  \n        ***![F5 Virtual Server List](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/F5-Virtual-Server-List-1300x700.png)***\n   3. **Configure Virtual Server Settings**:\n      * **Name**: Enter a unique name for the virtual server.\n      * **Source Address**: Set to \u20180.0.0.0/0\u2019 to allow traffic from all addresses.\n      * **Destination Address/Mask**: Enter the destination server address to which the F5 platform will route the traffic by default unless a connection Pool is in use.\n      * **Service Port**: Typically set to \u2018443\u2019 for HTTPS traffic.![F5 Fill In General Properties](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/F5-Fill-in-General-Properties-e1729513122258.png)\n   4. **Create Nodes**:\n      * Navigate to \u2018Nodes\u2019 under \u2018Local Traffic\u2019.\n      * Click \u2018Create'(+)  \n        ![Nodes Nodes List](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nodes-nodes-list-1.png)\n   5. **Fill in the necessary details:**\n      * **Name**: A descriptive label for the node.\n      * **Description:** Optionally, Add a description.\n      * **Address:** Enter the backend server\u2019s IP address or fully qualified domain name. Using FQDN allows the system to resolve the address dynamically if the IP changes.  \n        ![General Properties](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/general-properties.png)\n   6. **Create a Pool**:\n      * Navigate to \u2018Pools\u2019 under \u2018Local Traffic\u2019.\n      * Click on the \u2018Create'(+) button.  \n        ![Pools Pools List](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pools-pools-list.png)\n\n1. 1. **Configure Pool Settings:**\n      * **Name**: Give the pool a name that indicates its purpose or the services it supports.\n      * **Description**: Optionally, provide a detailed description of the pool\u2019s intended use or configuration.\n      * **Health Monitors:** Assign health monitors to automatically verify node functionality, ensuring that traffic is only directed to operational nodes. Select from the \u2018Available\u2019 list and use the arrows to move them to the \u2018Active\u2019 list.\n      * **Load Balancing Method**: Select a method for distributing traffic among the nodes in the pool. Common methods include:\n        + **Round Robin:** Distributes requests sequentially among the available nodes.\n        + **Ratio (member)**: Routes more requests to servers with higher assigned weights.\n        + **Least Connections (member)**: Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections.\n        + **Ratio (node)**: Assigns more requests to nodes with higher weights.\n        + **Least Connections (node)**: Sends requests to the node with the fewest active connections.\n        + **Weighted Least Connections (member)**: Prefers servers with fewer connections and higher weights.\n        + **Weighted Least Connections (node)**: Chooses nodes with fewer connections and higher weights.\n        + **Ratio Least Connections (member)**: Combines server weight with the number of connections to decide routing.\n        + **Ratio Least Connections (node)**: Applies weight and connection count to nodes for distributing requests.\n      * **Priority Group Activation**: This can be set to \u2018Disabled\u2019.\n      * **Add Nodes to the Pool:**The traffic from the pool will be routed to this node.\u00a0Click \u2018Add\u2019 in the \u2018New Members\u2019 section and provide details for each node, including Node Name, Address/FQDN, and Service Port.  \n        ![Go To Members > Add > Select Fqdn Node List And Select The Node You Created](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/configuration-1.png)\n\n1. **Associate Pool with a Virtual Server**\n   * **Open Virtual Server Settings**: Go to \u2018Local Traffic\u2019 > \u2018Virtual Servers\u2019.\n   * **Select Your Virtual Server**: Click to edit settings.\n   * **Link to Pool**: Locate the \u2018Default Pool\u2019 setting and select the pool you created.\n   * Review all settings and click \u2018Finished\u2019 to save and activate the virtual server.  \n     ![Default Pool](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Default-Pool-1.png)\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n\n**Virtual Server Not Receiving Traffic**:\n\nCheck the destination address and service port configurations.\n\n**Changes to Configuration Not Effective**:\n\nEnsure all changes are saved and consider service restarts if needed.\n\n### **FAQs**\n\n**Q: Why set the source address to \u20180.0.0.0/0\u2019?**\n\n**A:** This allows the server to accept traffic from any IP, avoiding blockages based on source address.\n\n**Q: Why use port 443?**\n\n**A:** Port 443 is the standard for HTTPS, providing encrypted and secure communication.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* + [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/)\n  + [Configuring SSL for F5 BIG-IP](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/configuring-ssl-for-f5-big-ip/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1729407356686.1729409421879.260&__hssc=267077713.27.1729409421879&__hsfp=203575498)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)!

Below is an example of a Playground Fusion Set.  \n![Fusion Set 1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fusion-Set-1.png)\n\n## **How to Manage Fusion Sets (Security Templates)**\n\nOnce a Fusion Set is created, there are several different actions you can take as part of managing the Fusion Set through its lifecycle.\n\n* + **Create** a new blank Fusion Set.\n  + **Select** the Fusion Set you want to use by clicking on its row in the drop-down.\n  + **Copy** an existing Fusion Set, which you can then rename, change, and share.\n  + **Open** the Fusion Sets drop-down.\n  + **Subscribe** all apps to the Fusion Set. This feature saves significant time because you do not need to manually subscribe each app to the Fusion Set one by one.\n  + **View details** of the Fusion Set, such as who created it, creation date, including all apps subscribed to the Fusion Set and more.\n  + **Export** the Fusion Set as a JSON file\n  + [**Freeze Fusion Set**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/freeze-fusion-set-security-templates/) \u2013 locks the Fusion Set so that it cannot be changed by others.\n  + **Delete** Fusion Set \u2013 if you no longer need it\n\n### Create a New Fusion Set\n\nClick \u201c**Create New Fusion Set**\u201d to create a new blank Fusion Set.  \n![Set Fusion Set Name](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Set-Fusion-Set-Name.png)\n\nEnter a name in the text box, and click **Save**.  \n![Fusion Set Name](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fusion-Set-Name.png)\n\n### Copying a Fusion Set\n\nYou can make a copy of the Playground Fusion Set to share with another team.\n\n* Hover on the Playground Fusion Set, and click on the **Copy** button.  \n  ![Copy Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-Fusion-Set-e1716825046154.png)\n\n### Subscribe all apps to the Fusion Set\n\n![Subscribe All Apps To This Fs](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Subscribe-all-apps-to-this-FS.png)\n\n### View Fusion Set Details\n\n* Edit Fusion Set Name\n* [Freeze Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/freeze-lock-moible-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-rcs-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n* Export Fusion Set as JSON file  \n  ![Fusion Set Details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fusion-Set-Details-e1716824896592.png)![Fs Details](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FS-Details.png)\n\nIn order to save time for users, Appdome automatically updates every account subscribed to a specific Fusion Set upon each change. So, if you enable a setting in an app subscribed to a Fusion Set, every app that\u2019s subscribed to the same Fusion Set will be updated as well.\n\n### Export and Compare Fusion Sets between Teams\n\nWhen collaborating within an Appdome team, multiple people may work on the same Fusion Set\u2014one creates it, someone else signs it, etc. You will probably want to review any changes committed to the Fusion Set, and you can do that by exporting its settings as a JSON file.\n\nEven when working alone, you can compare your different Fusion Sets and monitor your work.\n\nTo **Export** Fusion Set settings:\n\n* **Click the meatballs menu icon** to review the Fusion Set details.\n* For more details on how to share fusion sets between teams, see\u00a0[How to Release Fusion Set Templates Between Teams in a DevSecOps Build System](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/release-mobile-app-protection-templates-between-teams-in-devsecops-build-system/)  \n  ![Release Fs Between Teams](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Release-FS-between-teams-1.png)\n\n### Delete a Fusion Set\n\n![Delete Fs](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Delete-FS.png)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Freeze-Lock Protection Templates for Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/freeze-lock-moible-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-rcs-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n* [How to Release Fusion Set Templates Between Teams in a DevSecOps Build System](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/release-mobile-app-protection-templates-between-teams-in-devsecops-build-system/)\n* [How to Use Fusion Set History](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/use-fusion-set-history/)\n* [How to Enforce Naming Policies for Fusion Sets in Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/enforce-specific-naming-policy-for-mobile-app-protection-templates/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

Here, we\u2019ll cover the essential steps from uploading your SDK to downloading the secured version, including how to handle potential error messages and understand the fusion sets.\n\n## What is SDK Logic?\n\nSDK logic encompasses the core operational functions and algorithms of a Software Development Kit (SDK) that dictate how it interacts with other applications and services. This includes data processing routines, communication protocols, and security mechanisms inherent to the SDK. SDK Logic is fundamental to the performance and functionality of the SDK, enabling it to perform its intended tasks efficiently and securely.\n\n## Why It\u2019s Important to Obfuscate SDK Logic\n\nObfuscating mobile SDK logic is crucial because it protects the SDK from being easily understood or manipulated by malicious actors who perform reverse engineering. By making the code more difficult to read, analyze, and understand, obfuscation helps prevent reverse engineering and tampering. This ensures that sensitive data handling routines, communication protocols, and other critical operations remain secure, thereby protecting the integrity and security of the mobile applications that rely on these SDKs. Obfuscation adds a vital layer of defense, making it significantly harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities within the SDK.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Obfuscate SDK Logic with Appdome SDKProtect\u2122\n\nBefore starting the process of securing your SDK with Appdome, ensure you have the following:\n\n* + Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n  + A license for **SDKProtect\u2122**\n  + A valid **.aar file or iOS framework-** Confirm your SDK is in one of these formats, which are standard for Android and iOS development.\n\n## **Uploading Your SDK to Appdome**\n\nTo begin protecting your SDK with Appdome, first, upload your SDK\u2019s source files to the platform:\n\n* + 1. **Log in** to your Appdome account.\n    2. Navigate to the **+ Start** button.  \n       ![Start](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-27-at-12.38.08.png)\n    3. Click on \u2018**Upload SDK\u2019** and select the SDK files from your machine. Make sure the files are in the correct format specified by Appdome for seamless integration.\n    4. **Upload Method:** Choose between Appdome Console or DEV-API\n    5. **SDK Formats:** An .aar or iOS Framework file  \n       ![Upload SDK](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-27-at-12.41.09.png)\n\n**Handling Error Messages During Upload**\n\nIf any issues arise during the upload, Appdome will display an error message detailing the problem. This could be due to the file being incomplete, improperly packaged, or not a valid ZIP archive. Address these errors promptly to proceed with securing your SDK.\n\n![SDK upload error](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Upload-Error--362x366.png)\n\n**Understanding Fusion Sets**\n\nFusion Sets are security templates that allow you to select specific security functionalities to integrate with your SDK. Fusion Sets can include options like \u201cObfuscate SDK Logic\u201d, \u201cEncrypt SDK Strings\u201d, and \u201cProtect SDK Resources\u201d, among others. By selecting appropriate fusion sets, you customize the security features to meet the specific needs of your SDK, ensuring optimal protection.\n\nFor more details on Fusion Sets, see [How to Manage Fusion Set Security Templates iOS/Android](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/cyber-release-management/manage-fusion-set-security-templates-iosandroid/).\n\n### **Shielding Your SDK on Appdome**\n\n#### Building Obfuscate SDK Logic using Appdome\u2019s DEV-API:\n\n1. 1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the Obfuscate SDK Logic feature as shown below:  \n      ![Create Fs Obfuscate Sdk Logic](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Create-FS-Obfuscate-SDK-Logic.png)  \n      Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the SDK Threat-Shielding feature  \n      Note:\u00a0Naming the Fusion Set to correspond to the protection(s) selected is for illustration purposes only (not required).\n   2. To add the Obfuscate SDK Logic feature to this Fusion Set, follow the steps in the section\u00a0Building the Obfuscate SDK Logic feature via Appdome Console.\n   3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c\u2026\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set, as shown in Figure 3 below, and get the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):  \n      ![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/assets/copy_fs_id.png)  \n      Figure 1: Fusion Set Detail Summary  \n      Note:\u00a0Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n   4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, App Center, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI, or other systems:\n      * Build an API for the SDK \u2013 for instructions, see the tasks under [Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link)\n      * Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/orgs/Appdome/repositories)\n\n### **Building the Obfuscate SDK Logic feature via Appdome Console**\n\nTo build the Obfuscate App Logic protection using Appdome Console, follow the instructions below.\n\n* + 1. 1. **Where:** Inside the Appdome Console, go to **Build SDKProtect\u2122** > **SDK Threat-Shielding**\u00a0section.\n       2. **How:** Toggle on **SDK Threat-Shielding**. The feature Obfuscate SDK Logic is enabled by default, as shown below.  \n          ![Save Obfuscate Sdk Logic Fs](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Save-Obfuscate-SDK-Logic-FS.png)\n\n          Figure 3: SDK Threat-Shielding option\n       3. When you select SDK Threat-Shielding, you\u2019ll notice that the Fusion Set you created now bears the icon of the protection category that contains SDK Threat-Shielding.\n\n          ![Obfuscate Sdk Logic Toggle](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Obfuscate-SDK-Logic-Toggle-1.png)\n\n          Figure 4: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Obfuscate SDK Logic protection\n\n          Click\u00a0**Build My SDK**\u00a0at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in\u00a0Figure 4).\n\n**Congratulations!**The SDK Threat-Shielding protection has now been added to the mobile SDK.\n\n### **Downloading Your Secured SDK**\n\n* + 1. Go to the \u2018Download\u2019 tab on the Appdome platform\n    2. Find your recent build and click on \u2018Download My Built SDK\u2019.  \n       This downloaded SDK is now enhanced with robust security features and is ready for integration into your client apps.  \n       ![Download My Sdk](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Download-My-SDK.png)\n\n### **Certified Secure**\n\nThis certificate verifies that Appdome has secured your SDK (com.android.sdk.id) with specific security features, as identified in the certification details. Issued to your secured SDK, this certificate details the implementation of Appdome\u2019s SDK Threat Shielding, and SDK Threat Intelligence features that you have chosen to build into your SDK.\n\n![Appdome SDK Protection](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/appdome.aarnativelib-Certificate-SDK-Protect.png)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAppdome offers a powerful, user-friendly platform for SDK vendors to enhance the security of their mobile SDKs.

We invite you to use [Encrypt Resource](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/encrypt-resources-android/) for Android, which provides the same functionality.\n\n## \n\n## What Is Encrypting Assets in Android Apps?\n\nEncrypting mobile application assets involves securing the various components essential to an app\u2019s functionality, such as images, videos, audio, UI elements, and data files. These assets often contain sensitive information, proprietary algorithms, or important configuration data, making them attractive targets for malicious actors. Without encryption, attackers can reverse-engineer the app, extract or alter its assets, and potentially introduce vulnerabilities or steal intellectual property. Assets stored in the app\u2019s files system\u2014such as media, configuration, and localization files\u2014are particularly vulnerable if not encrypted, which could lead to unauthorized access, tampering, or even a compromised user experience. Asset encryption safeguards against unauthorized access, aligning with data protection standards and ensuring app functionality is not compromised, especially for media-rich apps or those handling sensitive user information. This aligns with best practices for safeguarding intellectual property and maintaining compliance with industry security standards like OWASP MASVS.\n\n## How Appdome Protects Android Apps with Asset Encryption?\n\nAppdome\u2019s dynamic Encrypt Assets plugin encrypts all assets stored in the application\u2019s asset folder, including images, audio, video files, configuration data, and UI elements. By applying AES 256 encryption, Appdome ensures that these assets cannot be accessed, modified, or extracted by unauthorized parties. The encrypted assets remain secure throughout the app\u2019s lifecycle, preventing reverse engineering, tampering, or intellectual property theft. Appdome\u2019s encryption process is seamless and works without requiring developers to change the code, offering strong protection while maintaining the app\u2019s performance and functionality.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Appdome\u2019s Encrypt Assets Plugins:\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s mobile app security build system to\u00a0**Encrypt Assets**, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for\u00a0**Encrypt Assets**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/)\u00a0and\u00a0[**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n\n## How to Implement Encrypt Assets in Android Apps Using Appdome\n\nOn Appdome, follow these\u00a0**3 simple steps**\u00a0to create self-defending Android Apps that\u00a0**Encrypt Assets**without an SDK or gateway:\n\n1. 1. ### [**Designate**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\u00a0the Mobile App to be protected.\n\n      1. #### Upload an app via the Appdome Mobile Defense platform GUI or via Appdome\u2019s DEV-API or CI/CD Plugins.\n      2. **Android Formats:**\u00a0.apk or .aab\n      3. **Encrypt Assets is compatible with:**\u00a0Java, JS, C++, C#, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, Cordova and other Android apps.\n   2. ### Select the defense:\u00a0**Encrypt Assets.**\n\n      1. Create and name the Fusion Set (security template) that will contain the Encrypt Assets feature as shown below:\n\n         ![fusion set that contains Encrypt Assets](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/assets/android_fs_image.png)Figure 1: Fusion Set that will contain the Encrypt Assets feature\n\n         1. Follow the steps in Sections\u00a0[2.2-2.2.2](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/encrypt-assets-in-android-apps/#2.2)\u00a0of this article to add the Encrypt Assets feature to your Fusion Set via the Appdome Console.\n         2. When you select the\u00a0**Encrypt Assets**\u00a0you\u2019ll notice that the Fusion Set you created in step\u00a0[2.1](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/encrypt-assets-in-android-apps/#2.1)\u00a0now bears the icon of the protection category that contains Encrypt Assets.\n\n            ![Fusion Set applied Encrypt Assets](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-25-at-18.10.47.png)\n\n            Figure 2: Fusion Set that displays the newly added Encrypt Assets protection  \n            Note:\u00a0Annotating the Fusion Set to identify the protection(s) selected is optional only (not mandatory).\n         3. Open the Fusion Set Detail Summary by clicking the \u201c\u2026\u201d symbol on the far-right corner of the Fusion Set. Copy the Fusion Set ID from the Fusion Set Detail Summary (as shown below):![fusion Set Detail Summary image](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/plugins/knowledge-base/assets/copy_fs_id.png)\n\n            Figure 3: Fusion Set Detail Summary\n         4. Follow the instructions below to use the Fusion Set ID inside any standard mobile DevOps or CI/CD toolkit like Bitrise, Jenkins, Travis, Team City, Circle CI or other system:\n            1. Refer to the\u00a0[Appdome API Reference Guide](https://apis.appdome.com/reference/get_upload-link)\u00a0for API building instructions.\n            2. Look for sample APIs in Appdome\u2019s\u00a0[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Appdome/appdome-api-python).\n      2. #### Add the\u00a0**Encrypt Assets**\u00a0feature to your security template.\n\n         1. 1. Navigate to\u00a0**Build**>\u00a0**Security**\u00a0tab >\u00a0**TOTALData\u2122 Encryption**\u00a0section in the Appdome Console.\n      3. Toggle On\u00a0**Encrypt Assets**.  \n         ![Encrypt Assets option](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Encrypt-Assets-Toggle-1.png)\n\n         Figure 4: Selecting Encrypt Assets\n      5. Initiate the build command either by clicking\u00a0**Build My App**\u00a0at the bottom of the Build Workflow (shown in\u00a0[Figure 4](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/encrypt-assets-in-android-apps/#figure_4_not_oneshield)) or via your CI/CD as described in Section\u00a0[2.1.4](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-data-encryption/encrypt-assets-in-android-apps/#2.1.4).\n\n      **Congratulations!**The Encrypt Assets protection is now added to the mobile app\n\n* ### **Certify the Encrypt Assets feature in Android Apps**\n\n  After building Encrypt Assets, Appdome generates a Certified Secure\u2122 certificate to guarantee that the Encrypt Assets protection has been added and is protecting the app. To verify that the Encrypt Assets protection has been added to the mobile app, locate the protection in the Certified Secure\u2122 certificate as shown below:![Encrypt Assets shown in Certificate secure](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TimeCard-Certificate-1-2.png)\n\n  Figure 5: Certified Secure\u2122 certificate\n\n  Each Certified Secure\u2122 certificate provides DevOps and DevSecOps organizations the entire workflow summary, audit trail of each build, and proof of protection that Encrypt Assets has been added to each Android app. Certified Secure provides instant and in-line DevSecOps compliance certification that Encrypt Assets and other mobile app security features are in each build of the mobile app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured Android Apps by using\u00a0**Encrypt Assets.**\u00a0There is no SDK and no library to code or implement in the app and no gateway to deploy in your network. All protections are built into each app and the resulting app is self-defending and self-protecting.\n\n**Releasing and Publishing Mobile Apps with Encrypt Assets**\n\nAfter successfully securing your app by using Appdome, there are several available options to complete your project, depending on your app lifecycle or workflow.

This guide will provide you with the steps to configure SSL certificates, ensure encrypted connections, and enhance security.\n\nSSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data\u2014a public key known to everyone and a private key known only to the recipient of the message. Implementing SSL ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remains private and integral, which is crucial for protecting sensitive data such as credit card numbers, passwords, and personal information.\n\nFor more details, see [How to Generate Public & Private Keys](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/generate-public-private-keys/)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* A virtual server configured on your F5 BIG-IP system, as outlined in the previous article.\n* Access to SSL certificates (Certificate and Private Key).\n\n## **Step-by-Step Instructions**\n\n1. Navigate to Local Traffic -> Profiles -> SSL -> Client\n2. Click the green + button to add a new SSL profile.  \n   ![Profiles Ssl Client](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/profiles-ssl-client.png)\n3. If you wish to use mTLS configuration for your client certificates, please refer to the article:\u00a0[Mutual TLS (mTLS) Configuration on F5](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/mutual-tls-mtls-configuration-on-f5/). Otherwise, set the Client Certificate checkbox to ignore.  \n   ![Client Authentication](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/66.png)\n4. Configure SSL Profile:\n   * Name: Give your SSL profile a unique and descriptive name.\n   * Parent Profile: Select an existing profile to inherit settings from, typically \u2018clientssl\u2019 for client-side connections.  \n     ![Cert Key Chain](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cert-key-chain.png)\n5. Add your SSL Certificate Key Chain  \n   ![Add Ssl Certificate Key Chain](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/add-SSL-certificate-key-chain-1.png)\n6. Go back to \u2018Local Traffic\u2019 > \u2018Virtual Servers\u2019.  \n   ![Local Traffic Virtualserver](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/local-traffic-virtualserver-1.png)\n7. Select your virtual server for editing.\n8. Locate the \u2018SSL Profile (Client)\u2019 setting and select the SSL profile you have just configured.  \n   ![Ssl Profile [client]](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SSL-profile-client-1.png)\n9. Confirm the settings to apply the SSL profile to your virtual server.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/)\n* [How to Block Mobile Bots with Client Certificates, Authenticate Legitimate Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention/block-mobile-bots-with-client-certificates-authenticate-legitimate-mobile-apps/)\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps in Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/use-appdome-build-2secure-in-azure-pipelines/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1729407356686.1729409421879.260&__hssc=267077713.27.1729409421879&__hsfp=203575498)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)!

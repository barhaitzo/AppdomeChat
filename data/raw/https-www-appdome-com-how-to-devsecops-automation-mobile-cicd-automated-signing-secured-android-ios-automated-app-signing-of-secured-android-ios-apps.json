A valid signature ensures the integrity of an app and stands as proof that the app has not been tampered with. Many individuals sign within their development and integration platform, but some are required to sign the applications on designated computers in order to preserve the signing credentials within a trusted environment.\n\n## Why Sign Secured Apps on Appdome\n\nAs an Appdome user, you can sign any built app either by using Appdome\u2019s built-in signing capabilities or using your own mechanism outside of Appdome. You are encouraged, however, to use the built-in app signing service on Appdome, because this service includes multiple input validation mechanisms to ensure proper signing.\n\nAppdome allows you to Securely Automate iOS/Android App Signing within a CI/CD without uploading the signing certificate to Appdome\u2019s cloud service.\u00a0Using Appdome, Signing secured mobile apps is easy, effortless, and does not require any prior knowledge.\n\nAppdome supports app signing for any development environment, framework and platform, including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps and non-native apps built in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic, and more. On Appdome, you can also sign an iOS application that contains extensions such as WatchKit, Share, Notification, File and Documents Providers and more.\u00a0 This robust implementation cuts deployment cycles and allows one to sign applications from a third-party vendor.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n### Prerequisites for Signing Secured Mobile Apps using Appdome\n\nIn order to sign an app on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\n* Appdome built mobile app\n* Signing Credentials\n\n## How to Sign Secured Mobile Apps\n\nFor information on signing Fused apps please refer to knowledge base articles signing iOS and Android apps.\n\n* [How do I sign iOS apps on Appdome?](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n* [How do I sign Android apps on Appdome?](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/)\n* [How do I sign iOS apps off Appdome?](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/privately-sign-secured-shielded-ios-apps )\n* [How do I sign Android apps off Appdome?](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/privately-sign-secured-shielded-android-apps/)\n* [How do I sign iOS apps with Auto-DEV Private Signing?](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/)\n* [How do I sign Android apps with Auto-DEV Private Signing?](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-android-app-signing-cicd/)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to Automate Secure iOS App Code Signing in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/code-signing-secure-android-ios/automate-secure-ios-app-code-signing-in-devops-cicd/)\n* [How Appdome Enables Signing Secured iOS Apps without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n* [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Using codesign](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-ios-apps-using-codesign/)\n\n## How Do I Learn More?\n\nCheck out [Appdome\u2019s blog](https://appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/)\u00a0or\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/) at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\nTo zoom out on this topic, visit Signing Apps on Appdome on our website.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/ \"https://www.appdome.com/\")!

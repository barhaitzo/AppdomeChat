With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida. For details, see [How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## General Information\n\nSaucelabs allows testing apps using its App Live and App Automate features. Both can be used to test Appdome-secured mobile apps. When using SauceLabs to run a Live Mobile App or Automated testing on an Appdome-protected app, you can choose between either of the following methods:\n\nThe following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered, the reason why, and how to avoid it (during the app building stage on Appdome):\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Prevent App Screen Sharing | SauceLabs allows a live view of the device screen while the test is running. | The app will recognize the screen recording but will continue running without crashing. |\n| Detect App is Debuggable | SauceLabs signs the app as debuggable upon installation. | The app will acknowledge the debuggable state but will continue operating normally during the testing process. |\n| Secure App Signature | SauceLabs resigns the app upon installation. | The app will detect the signature change but will not crash, allowing the testing to continue without interruption. |\n| Anti Tampering | SauceLabs are injecting new Dylibs during the re-signing process. | The app will detect tampering attempts but will not terminate the session, allowing testing to continue. |\n| Anti-Swizzling | Protects against method swizzling which could be used to alter app behavior during testing. | The app will detect swizzling attempts but will continue running, allowing for uninterrupted testing. |\n\n### **Live App testing \u2013 iOS**\n\n**To initiate Live Mobile App test of your test app in Saucelabs**:\n\n1.\u00a0Build the iOS app with Appdome security.  \nSauceLabs will re-sign your app by using a provisioning profile that includes a \u201cdebuggable\u201d entitlement before installing it.  \nThis may trigger Appdome\u2019s detection for debuggable applications. To prevent such a reaction, take either of the following measures:\n\n* Sign your app on Appdome by using a provisioning profile that includes the **debuggable** entitlement;\n\n**Note:**  \nFor additional measures to take during app build on Appdome, see the section **General** under iOS Apps above.\n\n2. After successfully building and signing your app on Appdome, [**log in to your Saucelabs account**](https://app.saucelabs.com/).\u00a0Alternatively, if you do not yet have an account, [**create an account**](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up).\n\n3. On the left sidebar, select **App Management**.  \nIf you see an option to select\u00a0between devices on a Virtual Cloud and Real Devices, select\u00a0**Real Devices**.  \n**![1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-1.png)****A****list of your apps will be displayed.**  \nIf you have not uploaded any app before, the list will be empty.\n\nIf your test app does not appear in the above list, you can upload it by dragging it or clicking\u00a0**\u201cchoose file.**\u201c\n\n********![Sacucelabs App Management](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-14.22.png)********\n\n* After you upload your test app, hover your mouse or cursor over it to display the\u00a0**Start Test**option.\n* Click\u00a0**Start Test**\u00a0to select the test device.  \n  ![iOS Start Test Button](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-14.23-2.png)\n* Select an available test device from the displayed list and click\u00a0**Launch**.  \n  This will start a manual test of the uploaded app on the selected device.  \n  ![Manual Test of Uploaded App](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-14.24.png)\n* To see live device logs, click **Log** on the menu on the right.  \n  ![iOS Live Device Logs](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iOS-LiveDeviceLogs.png)\n* When done, click **STOP**\u00a0on the right menu.\n\n## Automating App Testing on iOS\n\nWhen using Saucelabs with Automate App testing on an Appdome-protected app, certain security protections may be triggered due to advanced options that need to be enabled in the Saucelabs test environment. In addition to the protections that are triggered in live testing, as specified earlier in section **General Information about Testing in iOS Apps**, the following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered when performing automated testing, the reason why and how to avoid it (during the app building stage on Appdome):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **SauceLabs Specific Appium Capability** | **Reason** |\n| networkCapture | SauceLabs signs the app as debuggable upon installation |\n| resigningEnabled | SauceLabs signs the app as debuggable upon installation |\n| saucelaLabsImageInjectionEnabled | SauceLabs signs the app as debuggable upon installation |\n| saucelaLabsBypassScreenshotsRestriction | SauceLabs signs the app as debuggable upon installation |\n\n**Note:**\n\nTo avoid app resigning by Saucelabs, it is required to disable\u00a0*Instrumentation*and\u00a0*Image Injection*on Saucelabs cloud.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\nMost automation test tools can typically be used in either of two modes: **emulator mode** and **manual mode** (specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cemulator mode\u201d instead of \u201cmanual mode\u201d, the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device. This is expected because Appdome [ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) protects apps from running on emulators/simulators. Instead, you should run the automation test tool in manual mode.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on Browserstack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-on-browserstack/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on Browserstack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/test-appdome-secured-ios-apps-by-using-browserstack/)\n* [Test Appdome-secured Android Apps by Using Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-android-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [Testing Secured iOS Apps by Using Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [Testing Secured Android Apps by Using BitBar](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-using-bitbar/)\n* [How to test iOS apps by using Bitbar](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-ios-apps-by-using-bitbar/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6f333f485223b08a173d288e307b095c.1679313524563.1679322760586.1679391001880.3&__hssc=267077713.3.1679391001880&__hsfp=2327634395)!

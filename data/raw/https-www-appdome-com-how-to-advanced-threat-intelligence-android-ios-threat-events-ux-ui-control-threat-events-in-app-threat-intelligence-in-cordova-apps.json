This allows them to (1) ensure that mobile application workflows are aware of attacks and threats, (2) customize business logic and user experience based on the user\u2019s risk profile and/or each attack or threat presented, and (3) pass the threat data to other systems of record such as app servers, mobile fraud analysis systems, SIEMs, and other data collection points.\n\nThe purpose of Threat-Events is to enable Android and iOS applications to adapt and respond to mobile app attacks and threats in real-time. Using Threat-Events will ensure you keep users, data, and transactions safe.\n\n### Mobile Application Threat-Events vs. Threat-Scores\n\nAppdome Threat-Events can be used as a stand-alone implementation in Cordova Apps, or in combination with\u00a0Threat-Scores. Threat-Events provide the mobile developer with the in-app notification of each attack or threat, as well as the metadata associated with the attack. Threat-Scores provide the mobile developer with the Threat-Event event score and the combined (aggregate) mobile end-user risk at the time of the notification.\n\nThe figure below shows where you can find Threat-Events and Threat-Scores for each of the runtime mobile app security, anti-fraud, anti-malware, mobile antibot, and other protections available on Appdome:\n\n![55](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/55.png)\n\nTo enable Threat-Events with any runtime protection, select the check box next to Threat-Events for that feature. Doing so will enable (turn ON) Threat-Events for that feature. To enable Threat-Scores for any runtime protection, click the up/down arrow associated with Threat-Scores to assign a specific score to each protection.  \nThreat-Scores must have a value greater than zero (0) and less than a thousand (1,000).\n\nThreat-Events and Threat-Scores can be used with or in place of server-based mobile anti-fraud solutions.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Threat-Events with Cordova Apps\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to use Threat-Events with Cordova Apps.\n\n* Appdome account (If you do not yet have an account,\u00a0[create a free Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup)).\n* Appdome account class \u2013 Appdome DEV or higher.\n* Mobile Application Source Code.\n* Signing Credentials (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile) \u2013 see [Signing Secure Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/) and [Signing Secure iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/).\n\n### Code Snippet Required for\u00a0Using Threat-Events with Cordova Apps\n\nBefore consuming Threat-Events or Threat-Scores in your React Cordova Apps, confirm that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Threat-Events and/or Threat-Scores have been enabled ( turned ON) for the specific protection\n* You are using the correct identifiers for the Threat-Events for each protection.  \n  You can find the specific identifiers for each Threat-Event and Threat-Score in the knowledge base article associated with each protection.\n\nBelow is the code snippet required for using Threat-Events\u2122 and Threat-Scores\u2122 in Cordova Apps:\n\n```\n// RootedDevice will be dispatched only for Android\r\nwindow.broadcaster.addEventListener(\"RootedDevice\", function(userInfo) {\r\n    console.log(\"RootedDevice received! userInfo: \" + JSON.stringify(userInfo));\r\n    var internalError = userInfo.internalError;\r\n    var defaultMessage = userInfo.defaultMessage;\r\n    var timeStamp = userInfo.timestamp;\r\n    var deviceID = userInfo.deviceID;\r\n    var deviceModel = userInfo.deviceModel;\r\n    var osVersion = userInfo.osVersion;\r\n    var kernelInfo = userInfo.kernelInfo;\r\n    var deviceManufacturer = userInfo.deviceManufacturer;\r\n    var fusedAppToken = userInfo.fusedAppToken;\r\n    var carrierPlmn = userInfo.carrierPlmn;\r\n    var deviceBrand = userInfo.deviceBrand;\r\n    var deviceBoard = userInfo.deviceBoard;\r\n    var buildHost = userInfo.buildHost;\r\n    var buildUser = userInfo.buildUser;\r\n    var sdkVersion = userInfo.sdkVersion;\r\n    //\r\n    // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here\r\n    //\r\n});\r\n// JailbrokenDevice will be dispatched only for iOS\r\nwindow.broadcaster.addEventListener(\"JailbrokenDevice\", function(userInfo) {\r\n    console.log(\"JailbrokenDevice received! userInfo: \" + JSON.stringify(userInfo));\r\n    var internalError = userInfo.internalError;\r\n    var defaultMessage = userInfo.defaultMessage;\r\n    var timeStamp = userInfo.timestamp;\r\n    var deviceID = userInfo.deviceID;\r\n    var deviceModel = userInfo.deviceModel;\r\n    var osVersion = userInfo.osVersion;\r\n    var kernelInfo = userInfo.kernelInfo;\r\n    var deviceManufacturer = userInfo.deviceManufacturer;\r\n    var fusedAppToken = userInfo.fusedAppToken;\r\n    var carrierPlmn = userInfo.carrierPlmn;\r\n    var deviceBrand = userInfo.deviceBrand;\r\n    var deviceBoard = userInfo.deviceBoard;\r\n    var buildHost = userInfo.buildHost;\r\n    var buildUser = userInfo.buildUser;\r\n    var sdkVersion = userInfo.sdkVersion;\r\n    //\r\n    // Respond to mobile app attacks and threats here\r\n    //\r\n});\n```\n\n### Special Considerations for using Threat-Events with Cordova Apps\n\nCordova does not provide an out-of-the-box method to exchange messages between javascript and native code (LocalBroadcastManager for Android and NSNotificationCenter for iOS ). Cordova apps can register to receive ThreatEvents by adding the Cordova plugin [cordova-broadcaster](https://github.com/bsorrentino/cordova-broadcaster \"https://github.com/bsorrentino/cordova-broadcaster\"). For further on how to add the Cordova plugins, see Cordova documentation about\u00a0[cordova plugin command](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/reference/cordova-cli/index.html#cordova-plugin-command).\n\nAfter the cordova-broadcaster plugin has been added to the project, the app can register for a ThreatEvent by using the Cordova plugin interface to\u00a0call the method addEventListner:\n\n`window.broadcaster.addEventListener(<ThreatEvent Name>, <ThreatEvent Handler Method>)`.\n\n**Note**:\n\nThis plugin is cross-platform, so the code above applies to both Android & iOS.\n\n##### Compatibility with Android 14\n\nSince the Cordova plugin [cordova-broadcaster](https://github.com/bsorrentino/cordova-broadcaster \"https://github.com/bsorrentino/cordova-broadcaster\") uses LocalBroadcastManager to register a BroadcastReceiver when using the syntax in the code sample above, no changes required to make the app compatible with Android 14.\n\n### Meta-Data for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nBelow is the list of metadata that can be associated with each mobile application Threat-Event\u00a0and Threat-Score\u00a0in Cordova Apps.\n\n| Threat-Event **Context Keys** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| Timestamp | The exact time the threat event was triggered, recorded in milliseconds since epoch |\n| message | Message displayed for the user on event |\n| externalID | The external ID of the event which can be listened via Threat Events |\n| osVersion | OS version of the current device |\n| deviceModel | Current device model |\n| deviceManufacturer | The manufacturer of the current device |\n| fusedAppToken | The task ID of the Appdome fusion of the currently running app |\n| kernelInfo | Info about the kernel: system name, node name, release, version and machine. |\n| carrierPlmn | PLMN of the device. Only available for Android devices. |\n| deviceID | Current device ID |\n| reasonCode | Reason code of the occurred event |\n| deviceBrand | Brand of the device |\n| deviceBoard | Board of the device |\n| buildUser | Build user |\n| buildHost | Build host |\n| sdkVersion | Sdk version |\n| threatCode | The last six characters of the threat code specify the OS, allowing the Threat Resolution Center to address the attack on the affected device. |\n\nSome or all of the meta-data for\u00a0each mobile application Threat-Event\u00a0and Threat-Score can be consumed in\u00a0Cordova Apps at the discretion of the mobile developer and used, in combination with other mobile application data, to adapt the business logic or user experience when one or more attacks or threats are present.\n\n### Using Conditional Enforcement for Mobile Application Threat-Events and Threat-Scores\n\nConditional Enforcement is an extension to Appdome\u2019s mobile application Threat-Event framework. By using conditional enforcement, developers can control when Appdome enforcement of each mobile application protection takes place or invoke backup, failsafe, and enforcement to any in-app enforcement used by the mobile developer.\n\n### Verifying Threat Events in Cordova Apps\n\nAfter you have implemented the required Threat-Event code in your Cordova Apps, you can confirm that your Threat-Event implementation(s) is properly recognized by the Appdome protections in the\u00a0Cordova Apps. To do that, review the\u00a0Certified Secure\u2122\u00a0DevSecOps certificate for your build on Appdome.\n\nIn the Certified Secure DevSecOps certificate, a\u00a0correct\u00a0implementation of Threat-Events in your mobile application looks as seen below.\n\n![Ios Android Cert 2 1000px](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IOS-Android-cert_-2-1000px.png)\n\nWhen Threat-Events implementation appears to be missing in your mobile application, the following indication will be shown in the Certified Secure DevSecOps certificate:\n\n* **Android**:![Android Missing Threat Events Implementation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Android_Missing_Threat_Events_Implementation-650x130.png)\n* **iOS**:![Ios Missing Threat Events Implementation](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ios_missing_threat_events_implementation-650x132.png)\n\nFor information on how to view and/or retrieve the Certified Secure DevSecOps certification for your mobile application on Appdome, please\u00a0visit the knowledge base article [Using Certified Secure\u2122 Android & iOS Apps Build Certification in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/certified-secure-android-ios/using-certified-secure-android-ios-apps-build-certification-in-devops-cicd/).\n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Kotlin Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-kotlin-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Native iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-native-ios-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in React Native Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-react-native-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Swift Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-swift-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Native Android Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-native-android-apps/)\n* [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Maui, Xamarin Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/threat-events-in-app-threat-intelligence-in-xamarin-apps/)\n* [Implementing Threat Events \u2013 Best Practices](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/implementing-threat-events-best-practices/)\n* [How To Implement Threat-Events in Java](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/implementing-threat-events-in-code/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

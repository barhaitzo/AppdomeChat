Publish API to Google Play & Apple App Store. This article will cover how to Secure, integrate and deploy any Android and iOS apps in minutes as part of your CI/CD workflow.\n\nMore and more mobile developers and app makers are using Appdome as part of continuous mobile integration and deployment lifecycles (CI/CD). Adding an SDK, API, service, standard or feature to a mobile app is not a one-time event. Each time the new service or the mobile app changes, updates need to be made to ensure the service and app perform as expected. Appdome\u2019s no code mobile integration platform makes continuous mobile integration easy and painless.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions for using Appdome in a continuous mobile integration lifecycle, automatically deploying fully integrated mobile apps to enterprise and public app stores.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## Prerequisites to Autodeploy Mobile Apps on Appdome\n\nIn order to use deploying apps on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android).\n* Appdome-GO access\u00a0to deploy automatically to enterprise stores (Intune, Mass360 or Mobileiron)\n* [Appdome-DEV access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/) to deploy automatically to public stores ( Apple Appstore or Google Play)\n\n## How to Automatically Publish Apps to Any App Store\n\nTo deploy an app automatically, it must first be [built with Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/using-no-code-security-for-android-ios-apps/), and signed automatically on appdome (see [how to sign an Android app automatically](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/automatic-code-signing-for-secured-android-apps-on-appdome/), or [how to sign an iOS app automatically](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)).\n\nOnce your app is signed, you can access the Deploy Tab.\n\nNote: If you previously built and signed an app, but you created a new Fusion Set, or you are in the process of building an app, you might see \u201cNo Builds for App\u201d or \u201cYour Built App Is Not Signed Yet\u201d in the deploy page:\n\n![Publish secured android and ios apps to app stores](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/noBuilds_DeployPage.png) ![publish secure mobile apps to app stores](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/notFused_DeployPage.png)\n\n### Publish Secured iOS and Android apps to Any App Store\n\nAfter signing the app on Appdome, can you download the new app\u2019s binary to your computer and manually deploy in any way.\n\nAlternatively, you can use Appdome\u2019s to automatically deploy your app to the store of your choice.\n\n1. To enable Automatic Deploy, toggle \u201cON\u201d the **Automatic Deploy** option.\n2.

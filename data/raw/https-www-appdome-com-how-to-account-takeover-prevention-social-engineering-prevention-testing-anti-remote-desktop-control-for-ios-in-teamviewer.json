While it offers benefits for legitimate remote support and collaboration, it can also pose a security risk if misused by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive applications and data. This guide walks you through how to test the Prevent Remote Desktop Scam feature for iOS, a critical security layer provided by Appdome to ensure your application does not operate if TeamViewer is detected, effectively preventing unauthorized access attempts.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo test Prevent Remote Desktop Scam, you will need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup))\n* A license for **Prevent Remote Desktop Scam**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS)\n* Signing Credentials (see\u00a0[**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/))\n* Two (2) mobile devices.\n\n## Performing the Test\n\n1. Build an app with the Prevent Remote Desktop Scam feature enabled.  \n   For detailed instructions on how to build this feature, visit the main knowledge base article [How to Block Remote Desktop Exploits in iOS Apps.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/social-engineering-prevention/block-team-viewer-remote-desktop-exploits-in-ios-apps/)\n\n   [![iOS Prevent Remote Desktop Scam Toggle](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IOS_Prevent_Remote_Desktop_Scam_Toggle-2.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IOS_Prevent_Remote_Desktop_Scam_Toggle-2.png)\n\n   \u2026\n2.

( Download [TeamViewer Remote Control )](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teamviewer-remote-control/id692035811) from the Appstore website.  \n     ![Teamviewer 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/teamviewer-2.png)\n3. Open TeamViewer QuickSupport on Mobile Device 1.\n4. Open TeamViewer Remote Control on Mobile Device 2.\n5. Copy the number displayed under\u00a0**Your ID** from mobile device 1.\n6. Paste this number into the **Partner ID** box in the mobile device 2 and click **Remote Control**.  \n   ![Teamviewer 1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/teamviewer-1.png)\n7. On mobile device 1, click Allow. ****![Allow Remote Support](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Allow-Remote-Support-3-e1713358598894.png)****\n8. Click **Start Broadcast**.  \n   ![Start Broadcast](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Start-Broadcast-e1713357766493.png)\n9. On mobile device 2, toggle on \u201cI want to allow access\u201d and click continue. You should see the mobile device 1 screen on mobile device 2.  \n   ![Teamviewer Allow Access](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TeamViewer-Allow-Access-3-e1713359068382.png)\n10.

Many individuals sign within their development and integration platform, but some are required to sign the applications on designated computers in order to preserve the signing credentials within a trusted environment.\u00a0 With Appdome you can Securely Automate iOS App Signing within a CI/CD without uploading the signing certificate to Appdome\u2019s cloud service.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article provides step-by-step instructions on how to sign your secured iOS mobile app using Appdome\u2019s Auto-Dev private signing script.\n\nWe hope you find this knowledge base useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## How to Securely Automate iOS App Signing In CI/CD\n\nAs an Appdome user, you can sign any Appdome-Secured app either by using Appdome\u2019s built-in signing capabilities, Appdome\u2019s Auto-DEV Private Signing script or using or using your own mechanism outside of Appdome. It\u2019s your choice. However, [Signing ios applications outside of Xcode is complex](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/privately-sign-secured-shielded-ios-apps/). a developer will need to unzip the application, sign each executable and app extension with the correct certificate and provisioning profile in a specific order, and finally zip back the files to a .ipa process that is both tedious and prone to mistakes. To Securely Automate iOS App Signing In CI/CD, use Appdome\u2019s Auto-DEV Private Signing script. This will sign your app in seconds, correct every time.\n\nDuring the Appdome app Build, Build process adapters are added to the app to achieve the desired added functionality, therefore the app\u2019s original signature is invalidated and must be resigned to allow deploying the app on mobile devices. Appdome allows signing your Built app easily and simply by running a single script.\n\n**Appdome\u2019s Auto-Dev Private Signing iOS Apps script**\u00a0allows users to sign Built apps locally without uploading the signing certificate to Appdome\u2019s cloud service. The unsigned app is embedded in the script generated by Appdome. Running the script on your\u00a0trusted environment will extract and sign\u00a0the app using a certificate in your key chain.\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Securely Automate iOS App Signing In CI/CD\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to securely automate iOS app signing in CI/CD\n\n1. From within the **Sign** tab, select the signing method: **Auto-DEV Private Signing.**\n2. Upload the **Provisioning Profile** that matches your signing certificate and wait for Appdome to verify the signing parameters, then click on Auto-DEV sign Privately button.\n   * (optional): Toggle-ON Using **Manual Entitlements Matching** if you want to set an entitlement plist file to use when signing an app on Appdome.\n   * When this feature is OFF, Appdome will create an entitlements file based on the entitlements used to signed the non-protected app.  \n     For more information and a detailed manual on how to obtain the entitlement file for your app, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/extract-and-use-ios-entitlements-files-for-signing-secured-ios-app/).\n3. Click **Next** as the Signing Script Generation is Complete\n\n![private app signing ios apps appdome](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-04-09-at-4.28.29-PM.png)\n\n![Appdome Success message SCEP Certificates Mobile Authentication ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-04-09-at-4.32.42-PM.png)\n\nNext, Click **Download\u00a0My Built App** to download the automatic private signing script (sign.sh). Your Appdome-Built unsigned app is embedded in this script.![appdome private app signing ios apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-04-09-at-4.37.06-PM.png)\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome\u2019s Auto-DEV Private Signing Script\n\n* Appdome account\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[IDEAL](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/choosing-appdomes-ideal-account/)\u00a0or Higher.\n* [Appdome-DEV access](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* [iOS Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-p12-distribution-certificate/)\u00a0(e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile) \u2013 verify the certificate (with private key) was added to your local Keychain (to add it just \u2018double click\u2019 on the certificate).\n* Mac OS X computer with:\n  + Python software (version 2.7 or higher)\n  + [Codesign](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html) \u2013 Apple utility that\u00a0adds the signature directly to the executable file (Xcode version 10.1 or higher)\n\n### **How to Run Auto-DEV Private Script:**\n\nTo run the automatic private signing script, use the following command:\n\n```\n./sign.sh --signer <\"Signer Identity\" or sha-1 hash> --output <signed_app_name>.ipa\n```\n\nIf you need some help with finding the value to enter for the Signer Identity you can enter this command:\n\n```\n./sign.sh --help\n```\n\nNote! In some environments, you may be required\u00a0to grant executable permissions to the signing script (using chmod +x\u00a0command):\n\n```\nchmod +x sign.sh\n```\n\nThe **Signer Identity** is how the script identifies the certificate in the work stations Keychain Access. You can use either the certificate\u2019s **common name** (marked with double quotes) or its **SHA-1 fingerprint**.\u00a0To extract the certificate common name\u00a0/ SHA-1 fingerprint:\n\n* On your computer open the Keychain Access app.\n* Choose the certificate you wish to add and open the options menu (left-click).\n* Choose \u2018Get info\u2019.\n* Get the\u00a0certificate common name\u00a0/ SHA-1 fingerprint\n\n![script for codesigning ios apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Presentation1-3.png)\n\n![secure ios signing ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Presentation.png)\n\n**Important Note!**\u00a0The Codesign needs authorized access to your signing certificate in the Keychain. The password for your keychain is normally your user\u2019s password (the one you use to log in on your computer). To ensure the automatic private signing script will run without interruptions, we recommend to \u2018Always Allow\u2019 the authorized access to the Keychain.\n\n![codesigning ios apps on appdome](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Presentation15-170x81.png)\n\nNow you can run the automatic private signing script with your Signer Identity value:\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have multiple certificates with the same common name, the script will prompt you to use the SHA-1 fingerprint (which is always unique). if you enter invalid identifiers (type or non-existent certificate), the script will show an error and will print all the valid identities:\n\n```\n$ ./sign.sh --signer <invalid_singer> --output signed_app.ipa\r\n>>>\r\nERROR: The identity: invalid_signer was not found in the keychain.\r\nValid identities by name are:\r\niPhone Distribution: \r\niPhone Distribution: \r\nValid identitys by sha-1 are:\r\n\r\n```\n\nThe script will notify you if the Signer Identity you are trying to use doesn\u2019t match the provisioning profile used to seal the app, and will show you the valid identities:\n\n```\n$ ./sign.sh --signer <mismatched_singer> --output signed_app.ipa\r\n>>>\r\nINFO: Successfully matched certificate SHA-1 fingerprint [] in keychain\r\nERROR: The input certificate doesn't match the provisioning profile.\r\nValid certificates are:\r\nCert: [iPhone Distribution: ], with fingerprint: []\n```\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [Automated App Signing of Secured Android & iOS Apps on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/automated-app-signing-of-secured-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How Appdome Enables Signing Secured iOS Apps without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n* [How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Using codesign](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/sign-secured-ios-apps-using-codesign/)\n\n## How Do I Learn More?\n\nLearn more about [Signing iOS Apps on Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\u00a0or\u00a0[Request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

This enables organizations to build and secure apps while simultaneously ensuring that continuity and change control standards are met.\n\n**Note**:  \nWhenever you add an app to Appdome, a default **Playground Fusion Set** is created for each app.\n\nThe Playground Fusion Set cannot be frozen. If you want to freeze the settings included in the Playground Fusion Set, make a copy of this Fusion Set by following the steps outlined in the Knowledge Base article [How to Create Mobile App Protection Templates for Android & iOS Apps in DevSecOps Build System](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/create-mobile-app-protection-templates-for-android-ios-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/).\n\nAppdome licensed customers have several options for using the Freeze Fusion Set feature:\n\n* ***Freeze Fusion Set***Freezes the security features to be built into the mobile application. However, the \u201cAppdome Dev Options\u201d section will remain unfrozen.  \n  When You enable Freeze Fusion Set, the freeze settings will apply to all apps that are subscribed to that Fusion Set.\n* ***Freeze Appdome Version***  \n  Freezes the current Appdome Version, including all sub-versioning (for example 111.1.1).\n* ***Freeze Fusion Set and Appdome Version***  \n  Freezes both the security features and the Appdome Version.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using the Freeze Fusion Sets Feature\n\nTo use Appdome Fusion Sets features, you\u2019ll need the following:\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/) \u2013 IDEAL-DEV or higher\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* A license to **Freeze Fusion Set**\n* A license to **Freeze Appdome Version**\n\n### How to Use Freeze Fusion Sets\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to use the Freeze Fusion Set feature:\n\n1. Select the Fusion Set that you want to freeze.\n2. Click the **Details** icon to open the **Fusion Set Summary** modal.  \n   ![Initialfs Personal](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fs-details-e1692871812693.png)\n3. Use the **Fusion Set Summary** dialog box that opens now to toggle on (enable) the **Freeze Fusion Set** option.  \n   ![Fs Summary Tab](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fs-summary-tab.png)  \n   Select any, or either, of the following options:\n\n* + **Freeze Fusion Set** \u2013 Freeze only the security features enabled on this fusion set. However, the \u201cAppdome Dev Options\u201d section will remain unfrozen.  \n    ![Fs Freeze 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fs-freeze-2-1.png)  \n    **Note**:  \n    Freezing the fusion set requires adding an annotation. If you have important information about the Fusion Set ensure that you include it in the annotation, as it is not possible to add annotations after freezing.\n  + **Freeze Appdome Version** \u2013 to only freeze the Appdome Version (requires a relevant license).  \n    ![Freeze Tab](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/freeze-tab-e1692871651393.png)\n\nA frozen version set has several visual indications, as shown below:\n\n* A status bar under the title of the Fusion Set dialog box.  \n  ![Fs Title](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fs-title.png)\n* A lock icon in the Fusion Sets list. If the Appdome version is frozen, hovering the Appdome icon displays the Appdome version number.  \n  ![Freeze Lock Fs ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/freese-lock-fs-1-1.png)\n* A status bar at the bottom of the screen.  \n  ![Status Bar](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/status-bar-1.png)\n\n### Releasing Frozen Fusion Sets to Another Appdome Team\n\nIf you release a Fusion Set to another Team, you can choose whether to include the Freeze Settings. To learn more about releasing fusion sets to another team, read this [KB article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/share-mobile-app-security-templates-between-teams/).\n\n![Release Fs To Team](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/release-fs-to-team-e1692871861131.png)\n\nAfter clicking Release, the following notification appears if the release operation completed successfully.\n\n![Released To Team](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/released-to-team5-1.png)\n\n**Note**:  \nWhen releasing to another team, if you want the other team to access not in read-only, but to make any required modification, ensure that the team to which you release has the relevant permissions. If there is a mismatch, the notification shown below is displayed, in which case you need to contact [Appdome Support](mailto:support@appdome.com).\n\n![Release To Team Conflict](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Release-to-team-conflict.png)\n\nAfter the successful release to the team to which the Fusion Set was released immediately opens. You can select the row of the imported Fusion Set to see where it was imported from.\n\n### Fs Freezess\n\n### Unfreezing Fusion Sets\n\nTo Unfreeze a Fusion Set or unfreeze the Appdome Version, clear the check boxes near the relevant options.\n\n**Note**:  \nUnfreezing the Appdome Version will automatically apply the most recent Appdome Version to **all** apps subscribed to the Fusion Set.\u00a0 To avoid mistakes, you need to confirm this operation twice.\n\n![Screen Shot 2023 05 23 At 17.27.43](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2023-05-23-at-17.27.43-e1692871907164.png)\n\n## Additional Info About Freeze Fusion Sets\n\nAppdome Team Workspaces has a unique entitlement called Freeze/Unfreeze. This entitlement allows focusing individual team members\u2019 work on a specific part of the workflow, improving productivity, and avoiding mistakes along the way. To learn more about managing Team Workspace entitlements, see the Knowledge Base article [How to Set User Entitlements in Mobile App Security Projects](https://appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/appdome-basics/set-user-entitlements-in-mobile-app-security-projects/).\n\n[![Entitlements Freeze Unfreeze Appdome Version](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Entitlements_Freeze_Unfreeze_Appdome_Version-2.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Entitlements_Freeze_Unfreeze_Appdome_Version-2.png)\n\n### **No Coding Dependency**\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured Android and iOS apps using\u00a0**Freeze Fusion Sets.**There is no SDK and no library to manually code or implement in the app. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\n## How to Sign & Publish\u00a0Secured\u00a0Mobile Apps Built on\u00a0Appdome\n\nAfter successfully securing your app using\u00a0Appdome, there are several available options to complete your project, depending on\u00a0your\u00a0app lifecycle or workflow.

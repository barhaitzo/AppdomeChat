Using Imperva\u2019s WAF with Appdome\u2019s [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/) solution offers app developers a streamlined approach to protect backend APIs against malicious bots and botnets, credential stuffing attacks, DDoS, invalid traffic, and other automated attacks. In this guide, you\u2019ll learn how to integrate **Appdome\u2019s Docker Image** with **Imperva\u2019s WAF**.\n\nBefore delving into the steps, let\u2019s understand some of the terms used:\n\n**MTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security):**\u00a0Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a method for mutual authentication in which both parties in a network connection validate the SSL certificates presented by each other against a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.\n\n**Client Certificate:** In cryptography, a client certificate is a type of digital certificate that is used by client systems to send authenticated requests to a remote server.\n\n**Safe Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are determined to be safe or not at risk of any threat.\n\n**At-Risk Session:**\u00a0Represents sessions that are potentially under threat or have detected anomalies.\n\n**Header Payload:**\u00a0The data transferred in the header of HTTP requests or responses. Protecting this data ensures that it cannot be tampered with during transit.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Imperva & Appdome Docker Image\n\nFor utilizing Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense with Imperva, you\u2019ll need the following:\n\n* An Imperva account with admin permissions\n* An AWS, GCP, or Azure server with admin permissions\n* An Android or iOS app secured by Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense\n* An Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense License\n\n## Getting Started with Imperva\u2019s WAF Setup and Configuration\n\n**Note:** For any additional information, please refer to Imperva\u2019s documentation on [Cloud Application and Network Security](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/introducing/cloud-waf.htm)\n\n1. **Access Imperva Portal**\n   * Log in to your\u00a0[my.imperva.com](http://my.imperva.com/) account.\n2. **Configure Imperva Cloud WAF**\n   * To open the Origin Server Settings, log in to your my.imperva.com account. On the top menu bar, click Application.\n   * On the sidebar, click Websites and click a website name.\n   * On the sidebar, click Website Settings.\n   * Click Origin Servers.  \n     For more information, see Imperva\u2019s guide on how to set up [Origin Servers](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/settings/site-scraping.htm).\n3. **Set Up Redirect Rule**\n   * Create a redirect rule in the Imperva portal. This rule should specify the conditions for the redirection (e.g., specific URLs or patterns) and the target URL or domain where you want to redirect traffic.\n   * See Imperva\u2019s guide on how to [Create Simplified Redirect Rules](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/rules/simplified-redirect.htm)\n4. **Add a Client Certificate**\n   * See the Imperva\u2019s guide on how to setup [SSL Certificates](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/certificates.htm)\n5. **mTLS Configuration**\n   * See the Imperva guide on how to [Upload a CA certificate to your account](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/manage-client-certificate.htm)  \n      **IMPORTANT:** Configuring the mTLS is only necessary if you have\u00a0enabled mTLS in the Appdome Build process. Otherwise, skip ahead to the section *\u201c**Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image.*** **\u201c**\n\n### Setting up the server of your choice\n\nWhen the Imperva configuration has been completed, you can begin setting up your GCP, Azure, AWS server, or any cloud provider of your choice.\n\n**Links to Dedicated Appdome Knowledge Base articles**:\n\n* **GCP**: For setting up a server on the Google Cloud Platform and configuring it with **Appdome\u2019s Docker Image**, [follow this guide](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/configure-appdomes-docker-image-with-gcps-waf/).\n* **Azure**: For setting up a server on Microsoft Azure and configuring it with **Appdome\u2019s Docker Image**, [follow this guide](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/integrating-azure-waf-with-appdome-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/).\n* **AWS**: For setting up a server on Amazon Web Services and configuring it with **Appdome\u2019s Docker Image**, [follow this guide.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/integrate-appdomes-waf-with-aws/)\n\nTo learn more, see the installation instructions for\u00a0[Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)\n\n## Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image\n\nAfter setting up your server of choice, proceed to configure the Appdome Docker Image as outlined in our dedicated knowledge base article, [How to Configure Appdome\u2019s Docker Image for MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/configure-appdomes-docker-image/).\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n* [MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/mobilebot-detection/)\n* [Using Akamai WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrate-appdomes-docker-image-with-akamais-waf-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n* [How to Secure Android & iOS Apps in Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/mobile-app-security-anti-fraud-cicd/use-appdome-build-2secure-in-azure-pipelines/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)\n* [Using F5 WAF with Appdome MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-fraud-prevention-detection/mobile-bot-detection/integrating-f5-waf-with-appdome-for-enhanced-mobile-app-security/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=79098507.91fc95729d70bf17116f5cc6b5197e82.1683812569933.1697004449254.1697018033743.250&__hssc=79098507.5.1697018033743&__hsfp=3406240815)!

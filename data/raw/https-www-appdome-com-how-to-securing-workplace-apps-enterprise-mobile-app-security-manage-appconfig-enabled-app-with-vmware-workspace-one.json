Appdome offers three distinct ways configuration can be added to your application with no coding required, MDM, MAM and statically built into the app. If you you wish to use MDM, keep reading this article. In case you choose to work with EMM suite to manage your applications in MAM (Mobile App Mangement) setup, please refer to articles on [Intune](/enterprise-mobile-apps/uem-mam-sdks/microsoft-intune/), [VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch)](/enterprise-mobile-apps/uem-mam-sdks/vmware-workspace-one/),\u00a0[IBM MaaS360](/enterprise-mobile-apps/enterprise-mobility/ibm-maas360/), [Mobileiron](/enterprise-mobile-apps/enterprise-mobility/mobileiron/) or [BlackBerry Good](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/make-android-ios-apps-work-blackberry-dynamics/).\u00a0If you want neither, and you want static custom values to be added to your application during Build, go to [App Configuration](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-config-files-urls-plist-enterprise-apps/) article.\n\n### About Appdome for MDM AppConfig\n\nAppdome is a mobile integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that allows users to add a wide variety of features, SDKs and APIs to Android and iOS apps. Using a simple \u2018click to add\u2019 user interface, Appdome allows anyone to easily implement AppConfig to any mobile app \u2013 instantly, no code or coding required.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement. Likewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on specific MDM suite. The Appdome technology adds AppConfig to the app automatically with no manual development work at all.\n\nWith Appdome, mobile apps will use AppConfig as if it was natively coded to the app. Appdome for AppConfig is compatible with mobile apps built in any development environment including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps and non-native apps built in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic and more. This streamlines implementations, cuts development work, and ensures a guaranteed and consistent integration of AppConfig to any mobile app.\n\n### Prerequisites for using Appdome for AppConfig\n\nIn order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of AppConfig on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch)\u00a0MDM managed device\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## How to Add AppConfig to Any Mobile App on Appdome\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add AppConfig to Any Mobile App:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to [add a mobile apps to your Appdome account.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account, [click here](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup) to create an account.\n\n### From the \u201cBuild\u201d tab, Add AppConfig\n\nSelect the **Build Tab**. *Note: a blue underline will appear showing the step is active*  \nBeneath the Build Tab, you will find several service options. Select **Managment** tab**.**\u00a0*Note: a blue highlight will appear showing the category is active.*\n\n1. Click on **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**\u00a0to expand the section\n2. Click toggle to enable **Manage Appdome Security**\n3. Set up your MDM policies on\u00a0VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch)\u00a0[site](https://code.vmware.com/web/workspace-one/core-capabilities/App-Configuration)\n4. Click **Build My App**\n\nNote: Turning on AppConfig disables the 3rd Party SDK for EMM under the Management tab. If you build an app to integrate with an EMM SDK, it will be in MAM configuration and you don\u2019t need AppConfig in MDM configuration.  \nFrom your MDM, you can centrally manage the AppConfig settings. To do this, you will need to add some additional settings.\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-10-21-at-15.13.05-768x346.png)\n\niOS AppConfig Options in Addition to Options Available in MDMs\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-10-21-at-14.54.37-768x360.png)\n\nAndroid AppConfig Options in Addition to Options Available in MDMs\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen_Shot_2017-08-08_at_10.07.03_AM.png)\n\nSecurity Controls Available Through Implementation with App-Configuration Strings\n\n![](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Success.png)\n\n### \n\nAfter you have added AppConfig to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built App\n\nAppdome is a full featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\n### Sign the AppConfig enabled Appdome-Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-built app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode ) and [Signing an Android app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) are easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the Appdome-Built App to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-built app, you can download to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-built apps, please read [this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).  \nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome for AppConfig in your app!\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nCheck out Appdome [blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/) or [request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/) at any time.  \nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com) or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

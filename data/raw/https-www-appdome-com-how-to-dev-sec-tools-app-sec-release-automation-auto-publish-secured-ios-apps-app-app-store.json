In particular, they want a way to automatically distribute apps to the Apple App store to ensure continuous integration and evolution of mobile apps. On Appdome, application developers have the ability to automatically distribute their apps to the App Store. This knowledge base article provides 3 easy steps to auto-publish secured iOS apps to Apple App Store. Use the Appdome API to publish secured iOS apps to Apple App Store. No Code, No SDK, Continuous Security..\n\n## Prerequisites to Auto Publish Secured iOS Apps to Apple App Store\n\n* [Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/)\u00a0\u2013 IDEAL or Higher\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/)\u00a0\u2013 iOS (.ipa)\n* Apple account.\n* Mac Computer\n* XCode\n\nThis knowledge base assumes that you have correctly exported the app from Xcode and added the desired capabilities and other services on the Appdome platform to an app. It also assumes that you have successfully signed the app for app store distribution on the Appdome platform.\n\n## 5 Easy Steps to Auto Publish Secured iOS Apps to Apple App Store\n\nYou can automatically distribute apps to the Apple App Store directly from Appdome.\n\n1. Click on the\u00a0**Deploy**\u00a0Tab.\n2. Enable or toggle \u201cON\u201d\u00a0**Automatic Deploy** in the App Deployment section.\n3. **Choose App Store**in the Deploy Service dropdown.\n4. Fill-in your Apple ID username and password.\n5. Click on **Deploy My Built App** on the bottom right.\n\n![App deployment](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Presentation2-10.png)\n\nWhen you click **Deploy My Built App**, a distribution script is generated and downloaded to your computer.  \nFollowing Apple regulations, all app developers are required to distribute their applications using the build-in development environment on MAC computers (for example, xCode). The distribution script allows you to automatically complete the app distribution on your MAC.\n\nOpen a terminal window, And change the directory to the downloaded script location:\n\n```\ncd ~/Downloads/\n```\n\nThen, Run the downloaded Script:\n\n```\n./deploy.sh\n```\n\nThe deployment process will take a few moments. Once successful, you\u2019ll receive a message and an email notifying you that your enterprise app has been successfully distributed to the App Store.\n\nAfter the deployment has been completed, make sure to log into the [Itunes Connect portal](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/) and complete the app\u2019s description and configuration.\n\n### **How Do I Learn More?**\n\nRead the [blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/automatically-deploy-apps-to-public-and-enterprise-app-stores/) on automatically distributing enterprise apps to app stores or feel free to\u00a0[request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.6.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.a252d6bafcc2ff9ea15f20f0e653391d.1692615574684.1704974180237.1704976923959.345&__hssc=267077713.6.1704976923959&__hsfp=1931022262)!

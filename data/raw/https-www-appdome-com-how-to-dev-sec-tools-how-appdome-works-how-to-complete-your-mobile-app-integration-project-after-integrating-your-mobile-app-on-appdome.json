Appdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features to mobile apps.\n\nWe hope you find it useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions for Using No-Code Security for Android & iOS Apps\n\nThe Appdome Mobile Integration Workflow is a proprietary workflow that sits at the core of how Appdome automates mobile integration projects. The Workflow is part of the [Appdome Platform](/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/what-is-the-appdome-platform/). \u00a0It is\u00a0a stateful process that allows multiple mobile integration\u00a0projects to be completed in parallel, leveraging a variety of\u00a0productivity and collaboration tools. \u00a0Individuals or teams can use the Appdome Mobile Integration Workflow, allowing organizational\u00a0audibility,\u00a0traceability, and accountability in\u00a0completing mobile integration projects.\n\nThrough the Appdome Mobile Integration Workflow, users get one place to create and complete all their mobile integration projects. Through the Mobile Integration Workflow, users can upload any number and type of app, create Fusion Sets, and complete mobile integration projects through five easy-to-follow steps.\n\n![Appdome Workflow](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screenshot-2024-06-13-at-15.35.13.png)\n\n* Step 1: **+Start**, where the user uploads an app binary\n* Step 2:\u00a0**Build**, where the user selects the mobile services and builds them into the uploaded app\n* Step 3: **Context**, where the user can customize the app\n* Step 4:\u00a0**Sign**, where the user\u00a0signs the built app\n* Step 5:\u00a0**Deploy**, where the user downloads the built app and deploys it through industry standard distribution channels\n* Step 6:\u00a0**View**,\u00a0where the user gets access to integrated dashboards and\u00a0view usage statistics for his built apps\n\nThe entire Appdome No-code Mobile Integration Workflow is unique to each user. This means that the Appdome Platform remembers each user, including what each user performs and where each user leaves off.\n\nThe benefit of this aspect of the mobile integration workflow is that users do not need to complete their work in one session. \u00a0Instead, users can return to their integration project at any point in the workflow and at any time. This adds tremendous flexibility and convenience to the mobile developer and mobile professional in completing mobile integration projects.\n\nThe Mobile Integration Workflow also lets you store and/or retrieve your app binaries directly from Appdome and reset configuration settings on the fly, allowing for fast and efficient app distribution and re-deployment.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [Getting Started with Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/getting-started-with-appdome/)\n* [How Appdome\u2019s No-Code Mobile App Security Technology Works](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/how-appdomes-no-code-mobile-app-security-technology-works/)\n* [How to Secure an Android App Bundle (.aab) App Using Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/appdome-basics/secure-an-android-app-bundle-aab-app-using-appdome/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](https://support.appdome.com/hc/en-us)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

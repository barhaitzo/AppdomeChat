Whether you\u2019re building Appdome Mobile Security Suite, EMM SDKs, or an Identity SDK, your app will automatically be protected with ONEShield\u2122 advanced app shielding.\n\nThe app you are building on Appdome can be built with any native tool, such as Xcode for iOS or Android Studio, or any other framework, including hybrid and cross-platform frameworks such as Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, React Native, and Flutter. ONEShield\u2122 by Appdome supports only ARM 64-bit architectures.\n\n## ONEShield\u2122 includes all of the following app hardening features:\n\n### Anti-Debugging\n\n[Anti-Debugging](/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/block-debugging-tools-hacking-android-ios-apps/) will do the following, depending on the platform:\n\n* iOS:\n  + Connecting a debugger will cause the debugging client (lldb) to halt.\n  + After a sufficient wait time, the debug session will terminate and the debugger will crash.\n* Android:\n  + Attempting to attach to the process with a debugger, tracing tool, or code injectors will result in the app misbehaving in random and unpredictable ways. The app will eventually terminate.\n  + Attempting to debug the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using JDB (or anything that utilizes the JDWP protocol) will disconnect the debugger automatically.\n\n**Detect Debugger Code Manipulations:** Appdome actively detects and blocks any code manipulations performed by debuggers and other dynamic analysis tools during the app run-time. This includes blocking hooking frameworks and attack methods that include techniques such as method hooking, function hooking, and API hooking.\n\n### Anti-Tampering\n\n[Anti-Tampering](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/prevent-mods-code-changes-mobile-apps/) \u2013 Protects against all of the following:\n\n* Resigning the application\n* Attempting to Modify the Appdome adapter\n* Modifying the application\u2019s executable\n  + iOS: Main executable (see the [structure of an iOS application](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/secure-ios-ipa-apps-without-coding/))\n  + Android: DEX files (see the [structure of an Android application](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/secure-android-apk-apps-without-coding/))\n* Repackaging the app\n\n**Checksum Validation** \u2013\u00a0[Checksum validation](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/use-checksum-validation-prevent-changes-mobile-apps/) calculates a cryptographic hash (a unique fingerprint of information, binary data, and assets), and validates the hash at runtime, detecting any modifications to the app, app resources, configuration elements, and more.\n\n**App Integrity and Structure Scan** \u2013 [App integrity and structure scan](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/prevent-changes-mobile-app-logic-file-structure/) check the app\u2019s composition, data structure, data elements, and communication paths to validate the integrity and authenticity of the app, as well as to detect elements within the app that could be used as attack vectors (such as unknown or malicious URLs).  \nAppdome looks for weakening elements in the application, such as malicious URLs.\n\n### Anti-Emulator\n\n* In **iOS** apps, the [**Anti-Emulator**](https://www.appdome.com/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/) feature obfuscates selector references in the primary executable (which prevents cross-reference searches).\n* In **Android** apps, the [**Anti-Emulator**](https://www.appdome.com/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/) feature obfuscates all plaintext strings in DEX files.\n\n**Obfuscate Built Services:**\u00a0Obfuscates Appdome\u2019s code and the new customer-selected services added to the app during Fusion. In addition, the data embedded in Appdome\u2019s code will be encrypted to prevent common \u201crecon\u201d attacks (like searching for strings in the code).\n\n**Note:** 3rd party services will not be obfuscated. For example, the code responsible forTOTALDataTM Encryption will be obfuscated, while for\u00a0VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch), only the adapter code that glues the SDK to the application will be obfuscated, the\u00a0VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch)\u00a0code will remain as it is.\n\n**Prevent Running on Simulators \u2013** A standard method for attackers to compromise mobile apps is to run the app on a simulator, observe the app\u2019s behaviors and study how it functions in a running environment (a process called dynamic code analysis). Appdome detects when the app is running on a simulator and disconnects the app.\n\n**Prevent Running on Emulators \u2013** Detects if the app is running on an emulator. Emulators can be used to reverse engineer, hack your application, and sniff its communications, making it a security threat.\n\nAfter selecting and clicking\u00a0**Build My App**, in about 20 \u2013 40 seconds, your app will be protected with ONEShield\u2122\u201d.\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to add ONEShield\u2122 to Any Mobile App in seconds:\n\n### Upload a Mobile App to Your Account\n\nPlease follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).  \nIf you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n\n1. Click the\u00a0**Build**\u00a0tab.\n2. In the top menu, select any category (eg: **Security, Management, Access, Identity, Mobile Threat, etc**).\n3. (optional) switch on the feature and add any configuration or input requirements (if needed).\n4. Click\u00a0**Build My App**.\n\n[![Oneshield\u2122 By Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ONEShield\u2122-by-Appdome.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ONEShield\u2122-by-Appdome.png)\n\n##\n\n## After Adding\u00a0ONEShield\u2122 to a Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAfter you have added ONEShield\u2122 to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome-Built App\n\nAppdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read the Knowledge Base article\u00a0[How to Update App Icon Branding in Secure Android & iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps).\n\n### Sign the Appdome-Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-Built app, the app must be signed. [Signing iOS apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\u00a0and[Signing Android apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) on Appdome is easy. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app, and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the\u00a0Appdome-Built App\u00a0to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Built apps, please read the Knowledge Base article\u00a0[How to Auto Publish Secured Android & iOS Apps to app stores](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome\u2019s ONEShield\u2122 protection in your app!\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n* [How to Automatically Validate Android and iOS App Logic & File Structure in CI/CD](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/automatically-validate-android-and-ios-app-logic-file-structure-in-cicd/)\n* [How to Prevent Running on Simulators in Android & IOS Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/block-simulators-in-android-ios-apps/)\n* [How to Prevent Static App Patching in Android Apps](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/prevent-static-app-patching-in-android-apps/)\n* [How to Prevent Android Apps from Running on Emulators](https://appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/mobile-rasp-security/prevent-android-apps-from-running-on-emulators/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

Use Appdome to build the Microsoft Intune App SDK to Native Android and iOS apps or apps build with any other hybrid or non-native framework including, Cordova, React Native, Maui, Xamarin, Ionic, Flutter Apps and more. Appdome is a no-code solution. Use Appdome to secure enterprise apps instantly.\n\nThank you for your interest in Appdome and we hope that you find this article useful.\n\n## How to Make Mobile Apps Work with Microsoft Intune App SDK\n\nAppdome is a no-code mobile app security platform designed to add security features, like the Microsoft Intune App SDK, in mobile apps.\n\nAppdome\u2019s no-code mobile app security platform offers mobile developers, DevSec and security professionals a convenient and reliable way to protect Android and iOS apps without coding.\u00a0When a user clicks \u201cBuild My App,\u201d Appdome leverages a microservice architecture filled with 1000s of security plugins, and an adaptive code generation engine that matches the correct required plugins to the development environment, frameworks, and methods in each app.\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites to build secured enterprise apps. There is no need to wrap or manually code the Microsoft App SDK to your mobile apps. The Appdome technology adds the relevant standards, frameworks, stores, and logic to the app automatically, with no manual development work at all.\n\n*Appdome for Microsoft Intune* is one of the premier solutions available on Appdome. Appdome makes it fast and easy to build the Microsoft Intune SDK into any iOS or Android app, no matter how the app was built.\u00a0 Once the build is complete, you can deploy the secured\u00a0App directly to Intune, and then deploy the apps to mobile users from there. All data created within the App will be encrypted and protected inside a container, preventing other applications from accessing the app\u2019s data. This allows you to enjoy all the features the Microsoft Intune SDK offers as well as the additional security of [Appdome Mobility Suite](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/guarantee-android-ios-compatibility-uem-mam/) and\u00a0[BoostEMMTM by Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/boostemm-by-appdome/).\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Make Mobile Apps Work with Microsoft Intune App SDK\n\nPlease\u00a0follow these 3 easy steps to Make Android and iOS Apps work with Workspace ONE\n\n1.

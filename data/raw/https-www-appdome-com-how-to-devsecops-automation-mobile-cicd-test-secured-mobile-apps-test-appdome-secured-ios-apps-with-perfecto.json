Appdome seamlessly integrates with top mobile testing solutions, enabling customers to enhance mobile app security within their existing application lifecycle with the speed and agility of DevSecOps.\n\n**Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service (Recommended)**  \nCustomers with an Appdome SRM license can use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service to quickly and easily test their Appdome-secured mobile apps using Perfecto\u00a0without the need for different Fusion Sets. With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida. For details, see\u00a0[How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/testing-protected-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/).\n\n## General Information About Testing in iOS Apps\n\nThe following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered and the reason why:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome feature** | **Reason** | **Behavior with Build2Test** |\n| Prevent App Screen Sharing | Perfecto records the screen during tests, which triggers the screen-sharing protection. | The app will detect the screen recording but will continue running without crashing, allowing for uninterrupted testing. |\n| Prevent Code Injection | Perfecto may inject code or use scripts during automated tests, which can be detected as unauthorized code injection by this feature. | The app will detect the code injection attempt but will remain stable and functional during the test. |\n| Detect App is Debuggable | Perfecto signs the app as debuggable upon installation, which is detected as a potential security risk by this feature. | The app will acknowledge the debuggable state but will continue operating normally during the testing process. |\n| Secure App Signature | Perfecto might resign the app upon installation to match its test environment, triggering the app signature protection. | The app will detect the signature change but will not crash, allowing the testing to continue without interruption. |\n\n## Upload the App to the Perfecto Repository\n\n1. Log into your Perfecto cloud at ***<your-cloud>*. app.perfectomobile.com**\n\n2. Click on **\u201cAccount Setup\u201d**.\n\n3. Select **\u201cRepository\u201d** from the top bar.\n\n![Perfecto Bar](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/perfecto-bar-1.png)\n\n\u00a04. Click the upload button.\n\n![Perfecto Logo](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/perfecto-logo-3.png)\n\n5. Choose an app to upload.  \n6. Select and define additional data (e.g., private/public repository, name, tags),\n\n7. Click the Upload button.\n\n![Perfecto Upload A File](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/perfecto-upload-a-file-1.png)\n\n# Live App Testing\n\n1. Switch to the **\u201cManual Testing\u201d** tab on the top bar.\n\n![Perfecto Manual Testing](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Perfecto-Manual-Testing.png)\n\n2. Select a device and click **\u201cOPEN\u201d**.\n\n![Select Ios Device](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Select-iOS-Device.png)\n\n3. Once the device is initialized, click on the application\u2019s icon and then **\u201cINSTALL NEW**.\u201d\n\n![Perfecto Apps Menu Install New](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Perfecto-Apps-Menu-Install-New-1119x731.png)\n\n4. Choose your app from the repository folder.\n\n5. Click Next\n\n![Choose App From Repository](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Choose-app-from-repository-.png)\n\n6. Configure additional settings.\n\n7. Click Install App. Once installed, you can use the app and test it (Ensure \u201cresign\u201d is enabled).\n\n![Perfecto Install App2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/perfecto-install-app2-1.png)\n\n**NOTE**  \nIn case of any issues with the app, please send the device logs to Appdome Support by following these steps:  \n1. End the test and mark your results to save them.  \n2. Enter the link to your report.\n\n![Release Device ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/release-device_-1-395x731.png)\n\n3. On the top-right of the screen, look for the **export** button. Clicking it will open a dropdown menu from which you can download the device logs and iOS crash logs.\n\n![Export To Ppdf](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/export-to-ppdf-1.png)\n\n## Automating App Testing on iOS\n\nWhen using Perfecto with Automate App testing on an Appdome-protected app, certain security protections may be triggered due to advanced options that need to be enabled in Perfecto\u2019s test environment.\n\nPerfecto has several Appium capabilities, namely, a series of key-value pairs that allow you to configure your tests on Perfecto.  \nFor further details, see the [Capabilities Builder \u2013 Appium](https://help.perfecto.io/perfecto-help/content/perfecto/automation-testing/appium.htm)\u00a0webpage.\n\nThe iOS resign Appium capability can trigger Appdome protection features, as specified below.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **BrowserStack-Specific Appium Capability** | **Reason** |\n| iOSResign | By enabling iOSResign (a must for working with iOS apps on Perfecto), Perfecto will resign your app and trigger Appdome\u2019s Secure App Signature. |\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n**Issue: App Fails to Run on Testing Device**\n\n**Symptom**: The Appdome-secured application fails to launch or crashes when running automated tests.\n\n**Possible Cause**: Most automation test tools can typically be used in one of two modes:\u00a0**Emulator Mode** and\u00a0**Real Device** **Mode** (specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cEmulator Mode\u201d instead of \u201cReal Device Mode,\u201d the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n* Ensure that the automation test tool is set to **Real Device Mode**. Appdome\u2019s [ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/)\u00a0feature prevents the app from running on emulators or simulators.\n* Verify that the testing environment is using an actual device, not an emulator.\n\n**Issue: App Exits Unexpectedly or Displays Security Violation Message**\n\n* **Symptom**: The app closes unexpectedly or shows an error message stating, \u201cApplication has violated security policies, and it will be shut down.\u201d\n* **Possible Causes**:\n  + The app is detecting the presence of conditions it is protected against, such as running in an emulator, tampering, reverse engineering, or root detection.\n  + The testing tool might be running in **Emulator Mode** instead of **Real Device Mode**.\n* **Solution**:\n  + Switch the testing tool to **Real Device Mode** or **Manual Mode** to prevent the app from detecting an insecure environment.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-android-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [How to Test Secured iOS Apps on Lambdatest](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-lambdatest/)\n* [How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n* [Test Appdome-secured Android Apps by Using SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/appsec-release-orchestration-testing-protected-mobile-apps-test-appdome-secured-android-apps-by-using-saucelabs/)\n* [Testing Secured iOS Apps by Using SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-secured-ios-apps-on-saucelabs-mobile-devsecops-best-practices/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on BitBar](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-using-bitbar/)\n* [How to Test Secured Android Apps on Browserstack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/testing-secured-android-ios-apps-on-browserstack/)\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/?__hstc=267077713.6777b3fda0d62b04a09a73f1ca303fcd.1718886927298.1723978986269.1723982330479.140&__hssc=267077713.5.1723982330479&__hsfp=4047532501)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!

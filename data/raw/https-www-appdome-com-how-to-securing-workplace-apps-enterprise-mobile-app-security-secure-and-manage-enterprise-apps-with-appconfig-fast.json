Appdome offers three distinct ways configuration can be added to your application with no coding required. If your device is managed with MDM setup, keep reading this article. In case you choose to work with an EMM suite to manage your applications in MAM setup, please refer to articles on [Intune](/enterprise-mobile-apps/enterprise-mobility/microsoft-intune), [VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch)](/enterprise-mobile-apps/uem-mam-sdks/vmware-workspace-one/), [IBM MaaS360](/enterprise-mobile-apps/enterprise-mobility/ibm-maas360/), [Mobileiron](/enterprise-mobile-apps/enterprise-mobility/mobileiron/) or [BlackBerry Good](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-blackberry-dynamics/make-android-ios-apps-work-blackberry-dynamics/). If you want neither, and you want static custom values to be added to your application, go to [App Configuration](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-config-files-urls-plist-enterprise-apps/) article.\n\n### About Implementing MDM AppConfig\n\nUsing Appdome, there are no development or coding prerequisites. For example, there is no Appdome SDK, libraries, or plug-ins to implement. Likewise, there are no required infrastructure changes and no dependency on specific MDM suite. The Appdome technology adds AppConfig to the app automatically with no manual development work at all.\n\nWith Appdome, mobile apps will use AppConfig as if it was natively coded to the app. Appdome for AppConfig is compatible with mobile apps built in any development environment including Native Android and iOS apps, hybrid apps and non-native apps built in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native, Ionic and more. This streamlines implementations, cuts development work, and ensures a guaranteed and consistent integration of AppConfig to any mobile app.\n\nAppdome is a mobile integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that allows users to add a wide variety of features, SDKs and APIs to Android and iOS apps. Using a simple \u2018click to add\u2019 user interface, Appdome allows anyone to easily implement AppConfig to any mobile app \u2013 instantly, no code or coding required.\n\n### Prerequisites for Using Appdome for AppConfig\n\n* In order to use Appdome\u2019s no code implementation of AppConfig on Appdome, you\u2019ll need:\n* Appdome account\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/) (.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* MDM configuration on your device\n* [Signing Credentials](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-mobile-app-security/how-to-sign-my-app-on-appdome/) (e.g., signing certificates and provisioning profile)\n\n## Easy Steps to Secure and Manage Enterprise Apps with AppConfig Fast.\n\nPlease\u00a0follow these 3 easy steps to secure and manage enterprise apps with AppConfig\n\n1. [**Upload**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project)\u00a0an Android or iOS App to Appdome\u2019s no code security platform (.apk, .aab, or .ipa)\n2. In the Build Tab, under Management and EMM Services, Select the **ONE AppConfig by Appdome** Option (shown below)\n3. Follow the steps below and Click\u00a0**Build My App**\n\n![Add AppConfig in mobile apps for any EMM ](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Presentation1.png)\n\nWhen you build your application with **ONE AppConfig by Appdome**, all the following features are enabled automatically to your app:\n\n* Data-at-Rest Encryption \u2013 Sets up a secure and encrypted file container for the application data.\n* Copy-Paste Prevention \u2013 Resetics clipboard functionality to no protected applications.\n* Disable Screen Capture \u2013 Block screenshot functionality in the protected app and blur the application screenshot in the switchboard.\n* Jailbreak/Root prevention \u2013 Diables app launch on jailbroken/rooted devices.\n* Password/TouchID \u2013 Use AppConfig to turn on Fingerprint/Pincode authentication in your app.\n* Favor Native iOS/Android Security \u2013 Leverage existing iOS/Android built-in security mechanisms where applicable.\n\n### After Adding AppConfig to a Mobile App on Appdome\n\nAfter you have added AppConfig to any Mobile App on Appdome, there are a few additional steps needed to complete your mobile integration project.  \n![Appdome success message for AppConfig mobile apps](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Success.png)\n\n### Add Context\u2122 to the Appdome Built App\n\nAppdome is a full-featured mobile integration platform. Within Context\u2122, Appdome users can brand the app, including adding a favicon to denote the new service added to the app.  \nFor more information on the range of options available in Context\u2122, please read this [knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/update-app-icon-branding-secured-android-ios-apps/).\n\n### Sign the AppConfig Enabled Appdome-Built App (Required)\n\nIn order to deploy an Appdome-Built app, it must be signed. [Signing iOS app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode ) and [Signing an Android app](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/) is easy using Appdome. Alternatively, you can use [Private Signing](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/securely-automate-ios-app-signing-cicd/), download your unsigned app, and sign locally using your own signing methods.\n\n### Deploy the Appdome-Built App to a Mobile Device\n\nOnce you have signed your Appdome-Built app, you can download it to deploy it using your distribution method of choice. For more information on deploying your Appdome-Fused apps, please read [this knowledge base](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-android-ios-apps/).  \nThat is it \u2013 Enjoy Appdome for AppConfig in your app!\n\n### How Do I Learn More?\n\nCheck out Appdome [blog](https://www.appdome.com/dev-sec-blog/) or [request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/) at any time.  \nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at [support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com) or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n---\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting [Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

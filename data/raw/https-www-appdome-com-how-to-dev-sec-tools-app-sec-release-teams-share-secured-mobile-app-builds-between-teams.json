Each team passes the final product to the next team in the chain. Sharing tested and working fused builds is the way to achieve a smooth process from development all the way to production. Among many other features, [Appdome-DEV](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/) provides the ability to share fused builds across all teams. This way, Appdome users avoid doing the same thing for each app in each team, thereby reducing frustration and potential errors.\n\n### Prerequisites for sharing secured mobile app build\n\nTo be able to share builds, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* [An Appdome account](https://fusion.appdome.com/) \u2013\u00a0[IDEAL](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/choosing-appdomes-ideal-account/)\u00a0or Higher.\n* [Appdome-DEV](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/use-appdome-dev-secure-mobile-apps-at-scalte/)\n* [Use Appdome for Teams](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-teams/use-team-workflows-mobile-app-security-projects/)\n* [Mobile App](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project) \u2013 Android (.apk or .aab) or iOS (.ipa)\n\n## Easy Steps to Share Secured Mobile App Builds between Teams\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to share a fused build with any of your teams:\n\n1.

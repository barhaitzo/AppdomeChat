A valid signature ensures the integrity of an app and stands as proof that the app has not been tampered with. Your best option is to sign secured iOS Apps on Appdome.\n\nThis Knowledge Base article covers how to sign iOS apps using Appdome\u2019s built-in **Sign**\u00a0workflow.\n\nWe hope you find it useful and enjoy using Appdome!\n\n## Why Automate Signing iOS Apps?\n\nAs an Appdome user, you can sign any Appdome-built app either by using Appdome\u2019s built-in signing capabilities or using your own mechanism outside of Appdome. It\u2019s your choice. However, If you wish to deploy apps from Appdome, the process is quick and easy for any iOS app, including Native iOS, hybrid apps, and non-native apps built-in Maui, Xamarin, Cordova, React Native, Ionic, and more. Deploying apps from Appdome will leverage unique capabilities such as Automatic deployment of Fused apps into the [Apple App Store](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/auto-publish-secured-ios-apps-app-app-store/)\u00a0and\u00a0[Leading EMM Stores.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/byod-zero-trust/no-code-microsoft-intune/auto-publish-secure-enterprise-apps-built-intune/)\n\n## 3 Easy Steps to Sign Secured iOS Apps\n\nIn order to sign your iOS app, you\u2019ll need a valid signing certificate stored in the iOS development environment. To use your signing credentials, you\u2019ll need access to the following.\n\n* Please follow these steps to\u00a0[add a mobile app to your Appdome account](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project/).\n* If you don\u2019t have an Appdome account,\u00a0[click here to create an account](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup).\n* Built (Fused) mobile app\n* P12 Certificate File \u2013 A P12 certificate file is a certificate and private key concatenated into a single file, protected by a password.\n* P12 Certificate Password \u2013 The password used to unlock your P12 certificate file.\n* Provisioning Profile \u2013 A Provisioning Profile allows you to install apps onto your iOS device and includes the signing certificates, a list of supported device identifiers, entitlements, and an App ID.When the uploaded, non-protected app isn\u2019t signed, a manual entitlements file is required to complete the app signing:\n* Entitlement file \u2013 A plist file with the entitlements used for the application. Can be obtained from the Derived Data folder in Xcode (see this [article](/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/how-to-extract-ios-entitlements-files-for-signing-secured-ios-app/) for more information and a detailed manual on how to obtain the entitlement file for your app). For each Provisioning Profile, verify you upload the target entitlements file.\n\nFor more information and a detailed manual on how to create Signing Credentials,\u00a0[please read this knowledge base article](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-p12-distribution-certificate/).\n\nWithin\u00a0**Sign**, follow these 3 easy steps:\n\n1. Upload your**P12 Certificate File,****P12 Certificate Password**and\u00a0**Provisioning Profile**.\n2. (When the uploaded, non-protected app isn\u2019t signed) Toggle-ON Using\u00a0**Manual Entitlements Matching**\u00a0if you want to set an entitlement plist file to use when signing an app on Appdome.  \n   When this feature is OFF, Appdome will create an entitlements file based on the entitlements used to signed the non-protected app.\n3. Click\u00a0**Sign My App**.\n\n![Presentation1](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Presentation1.png)\n\n### Notes:\n\nIf your secured app contains any Extensions or Frameworks, multiple provisioning profiles will be required. Upload Provisioning Profiles to match the required entitlements for each Extension or Framework. The best practice is to upload a Provisioning profile to match each executable in the app. Read more information on\u00a0[signing apps with Extension or Frameworks](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-apple-watchkit-apps-without-xcode/).\n\nYou may be presented with an option to save the signing credentials for the current template. Click \u201cSave\u201d if you wish to save the credentials for this Template. Notice, if you click \u201cSkip\u201d, your signing credentials will not be saved and will be required every time this template is used to build an app.\n\nWhen you click the **SignMyApp** button, Appdome will analyze the built app\u2019s extensions, frameworks are resources and calculate a checksum that represents the exact state of each component within the app. Embedding the checksum into the app\u2019s executables will ensure that the app can\u2019t be modified or tampered with once the signing is complete.\n\nLearn more about\u00a0[Appdome\u2019s Checksum Validation](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/use-checksum-validation-prevent-changes-mobile-apps/), learn\u00a0more information on additional\u00a0[Anti-Tampering features provided by Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-apps/no-code-app-shielding/prevent-mods-code-changes-mobile-apps/).\n\nCongratulations! You now have a signed secured app.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n* [How to Privately Code Sign Sealed iOS Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/privately-code-sign-sealed-ios-apps/)\n* [How to Automate Secure iOS App Code Signing in DevOps CI/CD](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/automate-secure-ios-app-code-signing-in-devops-cicd/)\n* [How Appdome Enables Signing Secured iOS Apps without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/automated-signing-secured-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n\n### How to Learn More\n\n[How to Sign Secured iOS Apps Without Xcode](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/)\n\n[How To Sign Secured Android Apps Without Android Studio](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/signing-secured-apps/sign-secured-android-apps-without-android-studio/)\n\n[Request a demo](https://www.appdome.com/request-a-demo/)\u00a0at any time.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0[support@appdome.com](mailto:support@appdome.com)\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\nTo zoom out on this topic, visit the Appdome [platform](https://www.appdome.com/platform/) section on our website.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

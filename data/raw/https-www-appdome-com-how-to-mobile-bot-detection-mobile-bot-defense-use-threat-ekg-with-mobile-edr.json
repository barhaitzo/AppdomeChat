By utilizing threat events, Threat-EKG\u2122 provides regular updates on the device\u2019s health status to support secure operations.\n\n## How Does Threat-EKG Protect Mobile Enterprise Apps & Wearable Devices\n\nThreat-EKG\u2122 establishes a comprehensive security framework for both wearable and mobile devices, ensuring their communication with mobile apps and servers remains secure by enforcing\u00a0mobile threat detection and defense data across the entire enterprise infrastructure, including the mobile app, server, IAM, UEM, or WAF.\n\nHere\u2019s how it functions:\n\n**Payload Generation:** Threat-EKG sends payloads containing critical information about the wearable or mobile device\u2019s status, including risk session status, safe session status, payload timestamp, nonce, Appdome Signed Payload, Appdome ThreatID\u2122, and Appdome AppID\u2122.\n\n**Secure Transmission:** These payloads are transmitted securely across various mediums, ensuring secure communication between wearables and mobile devices, even in the absence of traditional network connections.\n\n**Threat Events:** Threat-EKG facilitates communication to the server through Threat-Events sent from Appdome to the mobile app, updating the mobile or wearable device health status and alerting the mobile app to potential threats.  \nFor further information on Threat Events, please refer to the knowledge base article:\u00a0 [Threat-Events\u2122, In-App Threat Intelligence in Mobile Apps](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/advanced-threat-intelligence-android-ios/threat-events-ux-ui-control/use-threat-events-in-flutter-apps/)\n\n**Data Encryption:** In secure sessions, Threat-EKG encrypts the payloads, ensuring that sensitive information, such as the app\u2019s health data, cannot be intercepted by attackers. This protects both the wearable and the connected mobile app from unauthorized access.\n\n## Prerequisites for Using Threat-EKG:\n\nTo use Appdome\u2019s mobile app security build system to\u00a0**Enforce Threat-EKG**, you\u2019ll need:\n\n* Appdome account ([**create a free Appdome account here**](https://fusion.appdome.com/signup?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1714644044945.1714659444692.301&__hssc=79098507.1.1714659444692&__hsfp=2507338650))\n* A license for\u00a0**Threat-EKG**\n* [**Mobile App**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/how-appdome-works/begin-no-code-mobile-app-security-project?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1714644044945.1714659444692.301&__hssc=79098507.1.1714659444692&__hsfp=2507338650)\u00a0(.ipa for iOS, or .apk or .aab for Android)\n* Signing Credentials (see\u00a0[**Signing Secure Android apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/code-sign-secured-android-apps-in-devsecops-build-system/?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1714644044945.1714659444692.301&__hssc=79098507.1.1714659444692&__hsfp=2507338650)\u00a0and\u00a0[**Signing Secure iOS apps**](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/code-signing-protected-android-ios/appdome-enabling-signing-secured-ios-apps-without-xcode/?__hstc=79098507.d98a04f99b04c452b04c0d8a7e46c20a.1702471298022.1714644044945.1714659444692.301&__hssc=79098507.1.1714659444692&__hsfp=2507338650))\n\n## Overview of Appdome Mobile Endpoint Detection & Response Features\n\n![Android Mobile Endpoint Detection Response Threat Ekg Toggle](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Android_Mobile_Endpoint_Detection_Response_Threat_EKG_Toggle.png)\n\nIn addition, Threat-EKG includes an optional Mobile Device & Connection Risk assessment for several different threat types.\n\nAll **Mobile Device & Connection Risk features** include the option to set DEVICETrust\u2122 levels.\u00a0To learn more about DEVICETrust\u2122, please refer to this knowledge base article**:**[How to use DEVICETrust\u2122 with MobileBOT\u2122 Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-devicetrust-with-mobilebot-defense/)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n* [How to use MobileBOT Source\u2122 with Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-mobilebot-source/)\n* [How to Use Session Headers in Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/use-session-headers-in-mobile-bot-defense/)\n* [How to Use Payload Timestamps In Mobile Bot Defense](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-bot-detection/mobile-bot-defense/learn-use-payload-timestamp-to-prevent-replay-attacks-and-stop-malicious-bots-using-appdomes-no-code-cyber-defense-automation/)\n* [How to use Appdome Mobile EDR](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-edr/mobile-endpoint-detection-response/use-appdome-mobile-edr/)\n\nIf you have any questions, please send them our way at\u00a0**[support.appdome.com](http://support.appdome.com/)**\u00a0or via the chat window on the Appdome platform.\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[Appdome](https://www.appdome.com/)!

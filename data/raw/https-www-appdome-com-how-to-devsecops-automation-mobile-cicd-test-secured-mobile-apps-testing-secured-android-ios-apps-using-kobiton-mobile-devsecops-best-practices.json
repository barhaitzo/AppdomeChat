Appdome works with all leading mobile automation testing solutions to help customers achieve comprehensive mobile app security at DevSecOps speed and agility, all within the app\u2019s existing application lifecycle.  \nUse Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service to test iOS and Android-protected applications on Kobitron for Automated testing.  \nCustomers with an Appdome SRM license can use Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service to quickly and easily test their Appdome-secured mobile apps using Kobiton without the need for different Fusion Sets. With Appdome\u2019s Build2Test service, Appdome\u2019s in-app defense model recognizes the unique signature of these testing services and allows for easy testing without issuing a security alert or forcing the app to exit, even if these services use tools such as Magisk or Frida. For more details, see [How to Use Appdome Mobile App Automation Testing.](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n\nThis knowledge-base article covers the steps needed to test iOS and Android mobile apps secured by Appdome using Kobitron\u2019s mobile test automation suite.\n\n## ****Appdome Protection Triggers** (Android)**\n\nKobiton allows testing apps using its Live Testing interface and Real Device App Automation testing suits. Both can be used to test Appdome-protected mobile apps.\n\nWhen using Kobiton to run Live Testing or App Automation testing on an Appdome protected app, some security protections may be triggered due to the nature of Kobiton\u2019s test environment. The following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered, the reason why and how to avoid it (during the app building stage on Appdome):\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Appdome Feature | Reason | How to prevent such identification |\n| Detect Developer Options | Required to interact with the device. | Enable Threat Events for Detect Developer Options with *In-App Detection* mode \u2013 Appdome will detect developer options is enabled, but will not close the app. |\n| Block Android Debug Bridge (ADB) | Required to interact with the device. | Enable Threat Events for Block Android Debug Bridge (ADB) with *In-App Detection* mode \u2013 Appdome will detect ADB is enabled, but will not close the app. |\n| App is Debuggable | Kobiton signs the app as debuggable during installation. | Enable Threat Events for *Anti-Debugging* with *In-App Detection* mode \u2013 Appdome will detect debuggable apps, but will not close the app. |\n| App Integrity | Kobiton resigns the app. | Enable Threat Events for Anti-Tampering with In-App-Detection mode. Appdome will detect app tampering but will not close the app. |\n| Prevent Screen Sharing Scams & Malware | Kobiton performs screen recording, so if this feature is enabled, all test videos may show a black screen. | Disable Prevent Screen Sharing Scams & Malware. |\n\n1. To enable Threat Events for Detect Developer Options on Appdome,\n\n* **Where:**\u00a0Inside the Appdome Console, go to\u00a0**Build**> **Security** Tab > **OS Integrity**\u00a0section\n* **How:**\u00a0Toggle (turn ON) **Detect Developer Options**, as shown below.\n* Select the Threat Events option In-App Detection.\n\n![896](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/896.png)\n\n2.

To disable Prevent App Screen Sharing on Appdome.\n\n* **Where:**\u00a0Inside the Appdome Console, go to\u00a0**Build**> **Anti ATO** Tab > **Social Engineering Prevention** section\n* **How:** Toggle (turn OFF) **Prevent Screen Sharing Scams & Malware**\u00a0as shown below.\n\n[![Android Test Apps With Kobiton](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android_Test_Apps_With_Kobiton.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android_Test_Apps_With_Kobiton.png)\n\n## How to Disable Google Play Protect\n\nGoogle Play Protect might also prevent an app from running on some Kobiton test devices. You may encounter a message like the following:\n\n![Disable Google Play Protect 2](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Disable-Google-Play-Protect-2-2.png)\n\nTo disable Google Play, Protect on a device:\n\n1. Launch Google Play on the device.\n2. Click the three dots in the upper right corner.\n\n![Google Play](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-play-1.png)\n\n1. Select Play Protect\n\n![Playstore Play Protect](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/playstore-play-protect.png)\n\n1. Click the gear icon on the top right corner.\n2. Disable **Play Protect** can scan this device and warn you about harmful apps.\n3. Confirm \u201cTurn off app scanning?\u201d by clicking **Turn off.**\n\n**![App Scanning](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/app-scanning-2.png) \u00a0![Play Protect Settings](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/play-protect-settings-2.png)**\n\n## ****Live Testing Android** Apps using Kobiton**\n\nHere are the basic steps to initiate a live test of your test app in Kobiton:\n\n1. [**Log in to your** **Kobiton** **account**](https://kobiton.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/signin), or\u00a0[**Create an account**](https://kobiton.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/registration) if you don\u2019t already have one.\n2. On the menu on the left bar, Click the **Devices** tab**.**   \n   You will see a list of test devices.  \n   **Note:** If you don\u2019t see any devices, go to the **PUBLIC DEVICES** on the top tab.\n\n![88](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/88-1.png)\n\n1. Select the Android platform by clicking the Android icon on the **Public Devices**\n2. Select your preferred test device by clicking the **Launch** button next to it. A new screen imaging the device will be displayed.\n\n![Manual Sessionandroid](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/manual-sessionandroid.png)\n\n1. Click the **Install Apps** button in the upper right corner.\n2. Select a test app among previously uploaded test apps, upload a new test app, or provide a test app URL.\n3. Once the app is selected and installed on the device, you will be able to start the test.\n4. While you are running the test, you can view the logs, open the inspector, or see real-time metrics on the right side of the screen by selecting the appropriate tab on the top right.\n5. When testing is finished, click the X button on the top right corner to end the session.\n6. After completing the test, you will be directed to the Session Overview screen with the test session information, video recording of the session, logs, etc.\n\n## **Real Device App Automation testing \u2013 Android**\n\nAs of the current document\u2019s issuance date, there are no particularly desired capabilities in Kobiton\u2019s real device script-based test automation that would trigger Appdome\u2019s protection features.\n\n## ****Appdome Protection Triggers** (iOS)**\n\nKobiton allows testing apps using its Real Device App Testing (Live) and Real Device App Automation testing suits. Both can be used to test Appdome-secured mobile apps.\n\nWhen using Kobiton to run Real Device App Testing or App Automation testing on an Appdome-protected app, some security protections may be triggered due to the nature of Kobiton\u2019s test environment. The following table describes which Appdome protection features may be triggered, the reason why, and how to avoid it (during the app building stage on Appdome):\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Appdome Feature** | **Reason** | **How to prevent such identification** |\n| Prevent Screen Sharing Scams & Malware | Kobiton allows a live view of the device screen while the test is running | Enable Threat Events for Prevent App Screen Sharing with *In-App Detection* mode \u2013 Appdome will detect the screen sharing but will not close the app. |\n\nTo enable Prevent App Screen Sharing on Appdome.\n\n* **Where:**\u00a0Inside the Appdome Console, go to\u00a0**Build**> **Anti ATO** Tab > **Social Engineering Prevention** section\n* **How:** Toggle (turn OFF) **Prevent Screen Sharing Scams & Malware**\u00a0 and **App Only Photos** as shown below.\n\n[![Ios Test Apps With Kobiton](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iOS_Test_Apps_With_Kobiton.png)](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/iOS_Test_Apps_With_Kobiton.png)\n\n## ****Live Testing iOS** Apps using Kobiton**\n\nHere are the basic steps to initiate the Real Device Live App test of your test app in Kobiton:\n\n1. [**Log in to your** **Kobiton** **account**](https://kobiton.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/signin), or\u00a0[**Create an account**](https://kobiton.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/registration) if you don\u2019t already have one.\n2. On the menu on the left bar, Click the **Devices** tab**.**   \n   You will see a list of test devices.  \n   If you don\u2019t see any devices, go to the **PUBLIC DEVICES** on the top tab.\n\n![Device List Ios](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/device-list-ios.png)\n\n1. Select the iOS platform by clicking the iOS icon on the **Public Devices**\n2. Select your preferred test device by clicking the **Launch** button next to it. A new screen imaging the device will be displayed.\n\n![Device Log Ios](https://www.appdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/device-log-ios.png)\n\n1. Click the **Install Apps** button in the upper right corner.\n2. Select a test app among previously uploaded test apps, upload a new test app, or provide a test app URL.\n3. Once the app is selected and installed on the device, you will be able to start the test.\n4. While you are running the test, you can view the logs, open the inspector, or see real-time metrics on the right side of the screen by selecting the appropriate tab on the top right.\n5. When testing is finished, click the X button on the top right corner to end the session.\n6. After completing the test, you will be directed to the Session Overview screen with the test session information, video recording of the session, logs, etc.\n\n## **Real Device App Automation testing \u2013 iOS**\n\nAs of the current document\u2019s issuance date, there are no particular desired capabilities in Kobiton\u2019s real device script-based test automation that would trigger Appdome\u2019s protection features.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\nMost automation test tools can typically be used in one of two modes:\u00a0**emulator mode**\u00a0and\u00a0**real device** **mode**(specific terms may vary according to the testing tool). If you use the automation test tool in \u201cemulator mode\u201d instead of \u201creal device mode\u201d, the Appdome-secured application will not run on the device. This is expected because Appdome\u00a0[ONEShield](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/mobile-app-security/no-code-app-shielding/no-code-mobile-app-shielding-resources/) protects apps from running on emulators/simulators. Instead, we recommend running the automation test tool in real-device mode.\n\nIf you see a message such as: \u201cApplication has violated security policies and it will be shut down\u201d, this means that (1) techniques such as emulators, tampering, or reverse engineering are present, and (2) the\u00a0[Fusion Set](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/dev-sec-tools/app-sec-release-automation/build-security-template-android-ios-apps/)\u00a0does not contain Appdome Threat-Events. This is expected because Appdome ONEShield protects against those conditions. You can either remove the triggering condition or use\u00a0[Appdome Threat Events](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/threat-events/mobile-threat-events/how-to-implement-appdomes-oneshield-threat-events-2/)\u00a0if applicable.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n[How to Use Appdome\u2019s Build-to-Test Service](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n\n[How to Test Appdome-Secured iOS Apps on SauceLabs](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/appsec-release-orchestration/security-release-management/use-appdomes-build-to-test-service/)\n\n[How to Test Appdome-secured iOS Apps on BrowserStack](https://www.appdome.com/how-to/devsecops-automation-mobile-cicd/test-secured-mobile-apps/test-appdome-secured-ios-apps-by-using-browserstack/)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThanks for visiting\u00a0[**Appdome**](https://www.appdome.com/)!
